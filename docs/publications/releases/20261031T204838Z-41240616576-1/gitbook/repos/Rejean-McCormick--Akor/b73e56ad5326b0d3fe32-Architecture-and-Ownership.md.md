# Architecture and Ownership

## Canonical separation

Akor must connect the existing products **without taking ownership of their business state**.

| Responsibility | Canonical owner | What Akor may do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario intent, role frames, fictional context, fragments | **Kontexte** | Validate references; adapt and project reviewed content |
| Coordination rules and deterministic preview | **kompose** | Consume a compiled plan and explain dependencies; do not execute a parallel lifecycle |
| World, immutable WorldRelease, routing context | **Orgo_Worlds** | Bind a reviewed scenario version and verify release references |
| Cases, Tasks, Signals, WorkflowVersion, transitions, recipients and operational authorization | **Orgo** | Submit explicitly permitted requests; render responses permitted for each viewer |
| Curriculum links, course content, activities, student work and learning evidence | **Ekole** (with Kristal/Spek content workflows) | Forward minimal learning references; never assign academic mastery |
| Actual human identity and access rights | School identity layer + Orgo/Ekole's own authorization | Map trusted sessions to scoped actor references without becoming a second identity provider |
| Media publication and consent | Approved school media/governance service | Display only approved, authorized assets |

```

Akor itself can be deployed as a service, a library of server-side adapters, or a dedicated sidecar **only after an architecture decision and threat review**. The current bridge is a **local dry-run tool**, not any of these production deployments.

## Operational invariants

1. **Exactly one live mission state owner: Orgo, even for solo missions.**
2. **Only Orgo (via its trusted authorization path) decides which role-specific content is releasable.** Kontexte story data and client-side role selectors are not authorization.
3. **Akor never performs direct database writes to Orgo or Orgo_Worlds.** Use documented controlled interfaces.
4. **WorldRelease is pinned for each running mission.** A later content revision must not silently rewrite a child's active adventure.
5. **kompose live `lifecycle` rules must not compete with Orgo's transitions.** They may inform validation and mock replay.
6. **Ekole learning evidence and Orgo task state are different records.** Do not infer mastery from `Task COMPLETED`.
7. **Teacher-only material never crosses into a learner projection** without approved transformation/publication.
8. **Failure is explicit.** If Orgo is unavailable, disable interactive mission actions rather than silently running a local state machine; ordinary Ekole lessons remain available.

## Integration entry points

- **Teacher review**: compiled mission, curriculum mapping, role demands, group configuration, permissions, WorldRelease and approval.
- **Mission launch**: authenticated teacher action, controlled server-to-server invocation, correlation and idempotency.
- **Learner projection**: only currently authorized instructions, messages, tasks and fragments.
- **Learner action**: validate the actor, mission, step and revision; never trust role names supplied by a browser.
- **Learning evidence**: reference educational artifacts without leaking answers into Orgo or exposing peer records.
