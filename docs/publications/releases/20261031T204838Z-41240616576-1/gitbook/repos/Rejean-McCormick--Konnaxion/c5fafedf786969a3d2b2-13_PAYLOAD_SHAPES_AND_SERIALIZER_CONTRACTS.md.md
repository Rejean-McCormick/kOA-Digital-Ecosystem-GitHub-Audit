# 13 — Payload Shapes and Serializer Contracts

**Document ID:** `13_PAYLOAD_SHAPES_AND_SERIALIZER_CONTRACTS.md`
**Pack:** ethiKos Kintsugi Update Documentation Pack
**Status:** Canonical / Technical Contract
**Last aligned:** 2026-04-25
**Primary purpose:** Fix request/response payload shapes, serializer responsibilities, naming conventions, enum values, and frontend/backend normalization rules for the ethiKos Kintsugi upgrade.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the canonical JSON payload shapes and serializer contracts for the ethiKos Kintsugi upgrade.

It prevents drift between:

* frontend TypeScript interfaces;
* Django REST Framework serializers;
* backend viewsets;
* service-layer adapters;
* future Kintsugi models;
* Smart Vote readings;
* EkoH snapshot references;
* Kialo-style argument mapping;
* Konsultations-style suggestions, ballots, and impact tracking.

The current ethiKos backend core is centered on `EthikosTopic`, `EthikosStance`, `EthikosArgument`, and `EthikosCategory`, exposed under `/api/ethikos/topics/`, `/api/ethikos/stances/`, `/api/ethikos/arguments/`, and `/api/ethikos/categories/` when registered. Compatibility aliases also exist under `/api/deliberate/...` and `/api/deliberate/elite/...`. 

---

## 2. Scope

This document covers:

* current ethiKos payloads;
* current serializer behavior that must remain stable;
* frontend normalization rules;
* Kintsugi first-pass additive payloads;
* Smart Vote / EkoH reading payloads;
* Kialo-style deliberation payloads;
* drafting payloads;
* impact/accountability payloads;
* error response shapes;
* pagination shape expectations;
* enum and value constraints.

This document does not authorize implementation by itself. New models, migrations, endpoints, and serializers must still be governed by:

* `07_API_AND_SERVICE_CONTRACTS.md`
* `08_DATA_MODEL_AND_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
* `09_SMART_VOTE_EKOH_READING_CONTRACT.md`
* `14_FRONTEND_ALIGNMENT_CONTRACT.md`
* `15_BACKEND_ALIGNMENT_CONTRACT.md`
* `22_IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG_TEMPLATE.md`

## 4. Source-of-Truth Rules

## 4.1 Backend Payload Truth

The backend API payload truth is DRF JSON using `snake_case`.

Backend serializers must expose field names that are stable, documented, and compatible with existing frontend service adapters.

## 4.2 Frontend Payload Truth

Frontend components may use normalized TypeScript shapes in `camelCase`, but raw API types must remain documented.

Frontend code must not invent backend field names.

Frontend service modules may normalize:

```txt
created_at -> createdAt
updated_at -> updatedAt
parent_id -> parentId
target_type -> targetType
target_id -> targetId
```

Normalization belongs in services/hooks/adapters, not scattered across page components.

The project guidance explicitly requires frontend API calls to use the services layer, respect existing `/api/...` path prefixes, avoid invented paths, and avoid renaming `/api/ethikos/...` to alternatives such as `/api/deliberation/...`. 

---

## 5. Serializer Design Principles

## 5.1 Stable Read / Flexible Write

Serializers SHOULD expose rich read fields but accept compact write fields.

Example:

* read may include `category_detail`;
* write may accept `category` or `category_id`;
* read may include `created_by`;
* write should inject `created_by` from the request user.

The current `TopicViewSet` injects `created_by` and resolves category from either `category` or `category_id`, while categories are exposed through a read-only viewset by default. 

## 5.2 Explicit Ownership

Serializer names must match the owning domain.

Examples:

```txt
EthikosTopicSerializer
EthikosStanceSerializer
EthikosArgumentSerializer
EthikosCategorySerializer
ReadingResultSerializer
LensDeclarationSerializer
ArgumentImpactVoteSerializer
ArgumentSourceSerializer
```

Do not create ambiguous names such as:

```txt
VoteSerializer
PostSerializer
OpinionSerializer
ClaimSerializer
GenericResultSerializer
```

unless the relevant ownership contract explicitly approves them.

## 5.3 No Silent Semantic Collapse

Serializers must not collapse distinct concepts:

| Concept              | Must remain distinct from                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `EthikosStance`      | `ArgumentImpactVote`, `ReadingResult`, ballot |
| `ArgumentImpactVote` | topic stance, Smart Vote ballot               |
| `ReadingResult`      | raw stance, raw ballot, source fact           |
| `EkoHSnapshot`       | vote, reading, ballot                         |
| `DraftVersion`       | decision outcome                              |
| `ImpactTrack`        | KeenKonnect project                           |

---

## 6. API Envelope and Pagination

## 6.1 List Response Compatibility

The current frontend must tolerate both DRF paginated and bare-list responses where legacy code already does so.

Allowed list shapes:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1
  }
]
```

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "next": null,
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

New endpoints SHOULD use standard DRF pagination where appropriate.

Frontend adapters SHOULD normalize both forms into arrays.

The current frontend Smart Vote polling code already handles both a bare list and a paginated `{ "results": [...] }` shape when reading `/api/kollective/votes/`. 

## 6.2 Detail Response Shape

Detail endpoints SHOULD return a single JSON object.

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "created_at": "2026-04-25T15:28:01Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-04-25T15:28:01Z"
}
```

## 6.3 Error Response Shape

Use DRF-compatible error responses.

Field-level error:

```json
{
  "value": ["Ensure this value is greater than or equal to -3."]
}
```

Non-field error:

```json
{
  "non_field_errors": ["Invalid payload."]
}
```

Detail error:

```json
{
  "detail": "Not found."
}
```

Kintsugi-specific serializers MAY add stable error codes later, but they must remain compatible with DRF clients.

## 7. Current Canonical ethiKos Payloads

## 7.1 `EthikosCategoryPayload`

### Owner

```yaml
OWNER: "ethiKos"
MODEL: "EthikosCategory"
ENDPOINT: "/api/ethikos/categories/"
CURRENT_STATUS: "current canonical model; endpoint only if registered"
```

### Read Shape

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Climate",
  "description": "Topics related to climate policy."
}
```

### Write Shape

Categories are read-only by default unless an admin endpoint explicitly permits writes.

```json
{
  "name": "Climate",
  "description": "Topics related to climate policy."
}
```

### Serializer Rules

* `id` is read-only.
* `name` is required.
* `description` may be blank.
* Public category listing may allow `AllowAny`.

The current contracts describe `EthikosCategory` as a topic grouping with `name` and `description`. 

---

## 7.2 `EthikosTopicPayload`

### Owner

```yaml
OWNER: "Korum / ethiKos"
MODEL: "EthikosTopic"
ENDPOINT: "/api/ethikos/topics/"
```

### Read Shape

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "title": "Should the city prioritize protected bike lanes?",
  "description": "A structured public deliberation about mobility priorities.",
  "status": "open",
  "category": 3,
  "category_detail": {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Mobility",
    "description": "Transport and public space."
  },
  "created_by": 7,
  "created_by_display": "alice",
  "expertise_category": 12,
  "total_votes": 18,
  "last_activity": "2026-04-25T15:00:00Z",
  "created_at": "2026-04-25T14:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-04-25T15:00:00Z"
}
```

### Minimum Read Shape

Serializers may omit nested display fields, but must preserve the core shape:

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "title": "Should the city prioritize protected bike lanes?",
  "description": "A structured public deliberation about mobility priorities.",
  "status": "open",
  "category": 3,
  "created_by": 7,
  "total_votes": 18,
  "last_activity": "2026-04-25T15:00:00Z",
  "created_at": "2026-04-25T14:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-04-25T15:00:00Z"
}
```

### Create Shape

```json
{
  "title": "Should the city prioritize protected bike lanes?",
  "description": "A structured public deliberation about mobility priorities.",
  "category": 3
}
```

Also accepted for compatibility:

```json
{
  "title": "Should the city prioritize protected bike lanes?",
  "description": "A structured public deliberation about mobility priorities.",
  "category_id": 3
}
```

### Update Shape

```json
{
  "title": "Updated title",
  "description": "Updated description",
  "status": "closed",
  "category": 4
}
```

### Allowed `status`

```yaml
TOPIC_STATUS:
  - "open"
  - "closed"
  - "archived"
```

### Serializer Rules

* `id` is read-only.
* `created_by` is read-only and injected from request user.
* `created_by_display` is read-only if present.
* `total_votes` is read-only unless explicitly managed by backend logic.
* `last_activity` is read-only unless explicitly managed by backend logic.
* `category` is required on create.
* `category` is optional on update.
* `status` must be one of `open`, `closed`, `archived`.

`EthikosTopic` is documented as the debate/consultation prompt with `status`, category, creator, vote totals, and activity timestamps. 

---

## 7.3 `EthikosTopicPreviewPayload`

### Owner

```yaml
OWNER: "Korum / ethiKos"
MODEL: "EthikosTopic"
LIKELY_ACTION: "TopicViewSet.preview"
ENDPOINT_PATTERN: "/api/ethikos/topics/{id}/preview/"
CURRENT_BUG_CONTEXT: "Deliberate preview drawer shows 'Preview / No data'"
```

### Read Shape

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "title": "Should the city prioritize protected bike lanes?",
  "description": "A structured public deliberation about mobility priorities.",
  "status": "open",
  "category": {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Mobility"
  },
  "stats": {
    "stance_count": 18,
    "argument_count": 9,
    "pro_count": 4,
    "con_count": 3,
    "neutral_count": 2
  },
  "last_activity": "2026-04-25T15:00:00Z"
}
```

### Serializer Rules

* This payload is a read-only preview projection.
* It must not replace `EthikosTopicPayload`.
* The preview drawer must accept this shape explicitly.
* If the backend returns only the minimal topic shape, the frontend adapter must normalize it into this preview shape.

The backend code contains a `preview` action intended to return a minimal topic preview compatible with frontend usage like `topics/{id}/preview`. 

---

## 7.4 `EthikosStancePayload`

### Owner

```yaml
OWNER: "Korum"
MODEL: "EthikosStance"
ENDPOINT: "/api/ethikos/stances/"
LEVEL: "topic-level"
RANGE: "-3..+3"
```

### Read Shape

```json
{
  "id": 1001,
  "topic": 42,
  "user": 7,
  "user_display": "alice",
  "value": 2,
  "timestamp": "2026-04-25T15:10:00Z"
}
```

### Create / Update Shape

```json
{
  "topic": 42,
  "value": 2
}
```

### Allowed `value`

```yaml
STANCE_VALUE_RANGE:
  MIN: -3
  MAX: 3
  INTEGER_ONLY: true
```

Semantic labels:

```yaml
-3: "Strongly against"
-2: "Moderately against"
-1: "Somewhat against"
0: "Neutral / undecided"
1: "Somewhat for"
2: "Moderately for"
3: "Strongly for"
```

### Serializer Rules

* `id` is read-only.
* `user` is read-only and injected from request user.
* `timestamp` is read-only.
* `topic` is required.
* `value` is required.
* `value` must be an integer between `-3` and `3`.
* A user should have one stance per topic.
* Updating a stance should upsert or replace the user’s previous stance, depending on backend implementation.

The current docs and frontend logic use `EthikosStance` as one user’s numeric topic-level position, constrained to `-3 … +3`; consultation-result hooks aggregate stance rows returned from `/api/ethikos/stances/?topic=<consultationId>`.  

---

## 7.5 `EthikosArgumentPayload`

### Owner

```yaml
OWNER: "Korum"
MODEL: "EthikosArgument"
ENDPOINT: "/api/ethikos/arguments/"
LEVEL: "argument/thread-entry"
```

### Read Shape

```json
{
  "id": 501,
  "topic": 42,
  "user": 7,
  "user_display": "alice",
  "content": "Protected bike lanes reduce severe injuries and improve access.",
  "side": "pro",
  "parent": null,
  "parent_id": null,
  "is_hidden": false,
  "created_at": "2026-04-25T15:12:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-04-25T15:12:00Z"
}
```

### Create Shape

```json
{
  "topic": 42,
  "content": "Protected bike lanes reduce severe injuries and improve access.",
  "side": "pro",
  "parent": null
}
```

### Reply Create Shape

```json
{
  "topic": 42,
  "content": "This depends on street design and winter maintenance.",
  "side": "con",
  "parent": 501
}
```

### Allowed `side`

```yaml
ARGUMENT_SIDE:
  - "pro"
  - "con"
  - "neutral"
  - null
```

### Serializer Rules

* `id` is read-only.
* `user` is read-only and injected from request user.
* `topic` is required.
* `content` is required.
* `side` is optional.
* `parent` is optional.
* `parent_id` may be exposed for frontend compatibility.
* `is_hidden` is read-only for normal users and writable only through moderation/admin flows.
* `created_at` and `updated_at` are read-only.

The current frontend documents a raw argument shape returned from `/api/ethikos/arguments/`, including optional `parent` and `parent_id` fields depending on serializer configuration; Konsultations suggestions currently normalize Ethikos arguments into suggestion objects.

    "author_visibility": "all",
    "vote_visibility": "all",
    "participation_type": "standard"
  }
}
```

### Serializer Rules

* This is a projection over `EthikosTopic` and `EthikosArgument`.
* It must not replace the canonical `EthikosArgumentPayload`.
* It may be assembled in a service layer instead of a database model.
* Children must preserve stable IDs.
* The tree must distinguish `side` from stance.

### Backend Write Projection

When backed by `EthikosArgument`, the service adapter posts:

```json
{
  "topic": 42,
  "content": "Protected bike lanes should be prioritized.",
  "parent": null
}
```

### Serializer Rules

* This is a projection, not a new canonical backend truth unless future Konsultations models are added.
* `consultationId` maps to `EthikosTopic.id` in the current implementation.
* `body` maps to `EthikosArgument.content`.
* `parentId` maps to `EthikosArgument.parent`.

The current frontend hook reads consultation suggestions from `ethikos/arguments/`, maps `EthikosArgumentApi` into a normalized `Suggestion`, and posts suggestions back to `ethikos/arguments/`.

### Serializer Rules

* This can be a frontend-computed aggregate or backend projection.
* It must preserve raw stance counts.
* It must not be confused with `ReadingResultPayload`.
* If weighted readings are included, they must be nested under a separate `readings` key.

## 16. Frontend TypeScript Alignment

Frontend service modules SHOULD define two layers of types:

1. raw API type;
2. normalized UI type.

Example:

```ts
export interface EthikosArgumentApi {
  id: number;
  topic: number;
  user: number | string;
  user_display?: string;
  content: string;
  side?: 'pro' | 'con' | 'neutral' | null;
  parent?: number | null;
  parent_id?: number | null;
  is_hidden?: boolean;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at?: string;
}

export interface ArgumentNode {
  id: string;
  topicId: string;
  author: string;
  content: string;
  side: 'pro' | 'con' | 'neutral' | null;
  parentId: string | null;
  isHidden: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt?: string;
}
```

Rules:

* API types mirror backend JSON.
* UI types may normalize naming and IDs.
* Normalization belongs in service/hook adapters.
* Components should not infer backend shape repeatedly.

---

## 17. Serializer Naming Contract

## 17.1 Current Serializers

```txt
EthikosCategorySerializer
EthikosTopicSerializer
EthikosStanceSerializer
EthikosArgumentSerializer
```

## 17.2 Proposed Kintsugi Serializers

```txt

ArgumentNodeSerializer
ArgumentSourceSerializer
ArgumentImpactVoteSerializer
ArgumentSuggestionSerializer

DecisionRecordSerializer

LensDeclarationSerializer
ReadingResultSerializer

DraftSerializer
DraftVersionSerializer
AmendmentSerializer
RationalePacketSerializer

ImpactTrackSerializer
ImpactUpdateSerializer

ExternalArtifactSerializer

AuditEventSerializer
```

## 17.3 Forbidden Serializer Names

Do not create ambiguous names:

```txt
VoteSerializer
ResultSerializer
OpinionSerializer
PostSerializer
ClaimSerializer
WeightedVoteSerializer
GenericPayloadSerializer
KialoSerializer
```

If such a name is unavoidable, the owning document must explicitly justify it.

## 19. Permission-Related Serializer Rules

## 19.1 Normal User

Normal authenticated users may generally create:

* their own stances;
* their own arguments;
* their own argument impact votes;
* their own suggestions where suggestions are enabled.

They may not:

* set `user`;
* set `created_by`;
* set moderation fields;
* publish readings;
* assign participant roles;
* reveal anonymous identities.

## 19.2 Admin / Moderator

Admins and moderators may:

* hide/unhide arguments;
* accept/reject suggestions;
* update discussion settings;
* assign roles;
* review audit records;
* publish or invalidate readings if authorized.

## 19.3 System / Compute Actor

System actors may:

* compute `ReadingResult`;
* assign `lens_hash`;
* attach `snapshot_ref`;
* create audit events for computations.

System actors may not silently mutate source facts.

## 20. Anti-Drift Rules

```yaml
FORBIDDEN:
  - "Do not rename EthikosArgument to Claim."
  - "Do not rename EthikosStance to Vote."
  - "Do not treat ArgumentImpactVote as EthikosStance."

## 22. Acceptance Criteria

This document is accepted when future frontend/backend work can answer the following without inventing new conventions:

* What is the raw backend JSON shape?
* What is the normalized frontend shape?
* Which serializer owns this payload?
* Which model backs the payload?
* Which fields are read-only?
* Which fields are injected from request context?
* Which fields are computed?
* Which values are valid enum values?
* Is this a source fact or derived projection?
* Is this topic-level, argument-level, decision-level, or reading-level?
* Does this payload preserve the separation between Korum, Konsultations, Smart Vote, EkoH, and Kialo-style deliberation?

If any payload cannot answer those questions, it is not ready for implementation.

---

## 23. Final Contract Statement

Payloads are not neutral.

They encode ownership.

For Kintsugi, every payload must preserve the central architecture:

* `EthikosTopic` remains the topic/debate/consultation container.
* `EthikosStance` remains the topic-level stance.
* `EthikosArgument` remains the argument/thread/claim-equivalent object.
* `ArgumentImpactVote` remains claim-level only.
* `ReadingResult` remains derived Smart Vote output only.
* `EkoH` remains context, not voting.
* Kialo-style deliberation remains a native Korum pattern, not a separate module.
* External OSS patterns remain mimic-first and adapter-only later.

The backend speaks stable DRF JSON.
The frontend normalizes through services.
The baseline remains visible.
The derived readings remain declared.
The serializers preserve the architecture.

## V4.1 EkoH profile payload extension

Canonical fields added to the EkoH profile projection: `rating_visibility`, `rating_publication_basis`, `rating_access`, and `score_history`. `rating_access` contains `allowed`, `level`, `reason`, and optional `scope`. Denied callers receive null rating fields rather than client-side hidden values. See `27_EKOH_RATING_VISIBILITY_AND_ACCESS_CONTRACT.md`.
