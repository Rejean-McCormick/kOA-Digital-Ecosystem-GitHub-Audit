# Getting Started

Start from a **local copy** of the full Arketype repository. Python **3.10 or later** is recommended; basic browsing and the included HTML catalogue do **not** require Python, internet access, or a database.

**Version note (Arketype 1.6.0):** legacy authoring remains default. Use `--authoring v11` only when you need a new empty Kit 4.0.0-draft.3 scaffold; it does not activate strict semantics. See [[Semantic-Authoring-v11]] and [[diK-and-Dictionaries]].

> **Snapshot warning:** The uploaded code snapshot fails the local validation suite due to absent application logo assets, missing v9 receipts, and an extra dossier form. Check [[Snapshot-Verification-2026-10-27]] before treating it as a fully verified distribution.

## 1. Browse the visual catalogue

Open `catalogue/index.html` from the extracted repository. Search by keyword, filter by family or structural pattern, and inspect the labeled diagrams. Each archetype card links to a descriptive JSON file; use-case cards link to their proposed composition recipes. The catalogue is an offline generated projection.

The generated HTML at `catalogue/index.html` is the primary visual interface. Any printable PDF should be checked in the particular repository release; it is not required to use the library.

## 2. Inspect the library

From the repository root:

```bash
python arketype.py list
python arketype.py search "protocol"
python arketype.py show procedure-protocole
python arketype.py profiles
python arketype.py profile suivi-employe
python arketype.py recipes
python arketype.py recipe troubleshooting-systeme
```

The CLI uses stable *slugs* (for example `etat-systemes` and `dossier-suivi`). Reader-facing text is in English. Existing French-derived slugs and machine property names are retained as stable identifiers to preserve compatibility.

## 3. Preview an instantiation

```bash
python arketype.py create   --type diagnostic-causal   --slug lab-diagnostics   --title "Lab Diagnostics"   --parent .   --dry-run
```

The dry run reports the intended destination, archetype and design plan. It writes nothing.

## 4. Create a new, blank Kristal

Run the same command without `--dry-run`. Arketype asks the bundled Authoring Kit to initialize an independent workspace; it copies optional structure proposals into `design/`, verifies the local workspace, and refuses to overwrite an existing destination.

The generated template is **empty**, not a populated diagnostic knowledge base. Before adding real data, define domain identity, provenance, privacy constraints, semantic ownership, logical contracts and validation criteria.

## 5. Optional v11-ready workspace (Kit 4.0.0-draft.3)

```bash
python arketype.py create --type referentiel-semantique \
  --slug exemple-v11 --title "Exemple v11" --parent . \
  --authoring v11
python arketype.py semantic-status --path ./exemple-v11
```

The new state is deliberately empty, with a noncanonical readiness guide. Actual KQ/KP and dictionary registration, opt-in validation and `build-v9` are separate Authoring Kit operations. After a valid v11 setup, an approved diK catalog can be imported as a new, separately validated revision by the Kit, never activated automatically. See [[Semantic-Authoring-v11]] and [[diK-Catalog-Exchange-v11]].

## 6. Preview a composition proposal

```bash
python arketype.py compose   --recipe troubleshooting-systeme   --slug diagnostics-plan   --title "Diagnostics Plan"   --parent .   --dry-run
```

This produces a preview of components and unresolved responsibilities. It never fuses independently owned canonical states.

## 7. Validate

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python arketype.py validate --check-kit
```

To regenerate the HTML after updating source JSON:

```bash
python arketype.py build-html
```

## Desktop launcher (Windows)

Double-click **`Lancer_Arketype.pyw`** with Python 3.10+ and Tkinter. It opens one application with **Home**, **Catalogue**, **Create Kristal**, and **Developer Ops**. Search the catalogue, choose an archetype or use-case profile, and send it directly to the creation form. Preview a workspace before creating it.

Developer Ops offers local `list`, `search`, `show`, `profile`, `recipes`, `validate`, `validate --check-kit`, `test`, `inventory`, and `build-html` operations. Enter `help` for the exact allowlist. There is **no arbitrary shell**, remote publication, or activation. Long-running operations run in the background so the window stays responsive. The launcher references the original SVG and a derived PNG at the `assets/` paths and uses brand color `#1E6864`. **The uploaded code snapshot lacks those application image files**, so verify the complete checkout before relying on branding. No logo is embedded in the README.

Native Windows testing remains a separate validation step; headless GUI tests have been performed on Linux.
