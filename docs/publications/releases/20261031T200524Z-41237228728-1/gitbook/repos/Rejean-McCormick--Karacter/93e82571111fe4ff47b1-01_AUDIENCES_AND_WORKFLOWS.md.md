# Audiences, jobs to be done and end-to-end workflows

## Primary audiences

1. **Parent / educator:** explores fictional personalities, contextual strengths and emotional reactions with a child. Needs easy vocabulary, non-judgmental examples and guided comparisons.
2. **Character designer / illustrator:** needs coherent design signatures, themed transformations, multiple expressions and a traceable visual brief.
3. **Writer / narrative designer:** needs motivation, contradiction, choices, relationships and growth across scenes.
4. **Game creator:** needs an editable cast, coherent tendencies and exportable prompts; not a game statistics engine.

## Canonical journeys

### Journey A: Create a first character (Explorer)

1. Open Karacter, select language; choose `New` or one archetype starter.
2. Enter name, collection, archetype/role and optional appearance signature.
3. Adjust four visible paired polarities; each pole shows 0..6; the two sum to 6.
4. Explore a simple scenario; view three **possible** responses with short, human-readable reasons.
5. Save, export TXT and optionally generate a portrait prompt.
6. Switch to Studio at any time without losing data or making another character.

### Journey B: Build a nuanced protagonist (Studio)

1. Complete the eight axes and any optional custom axis.
2. Record desire, need, fear, value, belief, contradiction, turning point and growth idea.
3. Add relationships to existing characters.
4. Add a timeline milestone, preserving the original baseline.
5. Simulate a scenario with chosen stakes and relationship target; compare alternatives and manually pin a preferred response.

### Journey C: Compare different perspectives

1. Select Character A and Character B (different IDs).
2. Choose one shared scenario, identical stakes and shared factual context.
3. Generate three plausible response paths per character.
4. Display emotion / interpretation / action / need / tension / influencing evidence side by side.
5. Discuss differences without scoring which character was right.
6. Export a comparison text document; keep it separate from character canonical data unless explicitly saved.

### Journey D: Multi-universe visual creation

1. Select a character, current visual theme and image mode: portrait / expressions / action.
2. Generate a prompt from immutable character identity + visual signature + context, not every axis mechanically.
3. Copy prompt to an external image tool and generate a square image.
4. Drop image into the exact `character/theme/mode` slot; preview and confirm replacement if occupied.
5. Download normalized, sanitized file; restore all image bytes via backup.

### Journey E: Safe migration and recovery

1. Export full v5 ZIP/JSON first.
2. Open v6; choose Import, preview counts, duplicates, format version and expected changes.
3. Choose replace/merge (if supported) with explicit safeguards; confirm.
4. Verify reference character, polarity values and at least one image per mode.
5. Export v6 backup; test independent restore.

## UX success signals

- User understands what a 5/1 pair *means* without external instruction.
- A comparison clearly explains why each character might respond differently, without moral rankings.
- Every action that deletes or replaces something offers an understandable confirmation or undo.
- Image and story work flows do not require a network connection (except using an outside image generator).
