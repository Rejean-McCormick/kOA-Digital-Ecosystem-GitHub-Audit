# Konnaxion Host Contract — Universes / Worlds

**Status:** canonical Konnaxion host-boundary document  
**Engine/spec owner:** sibling repository/package `Konnaxion_Worlds`  
**Current engine lock:** `KX-UNIVERSES-1` over `KX-WORLDS-1`; distribution `konnaxion-worlds==0.3.7` pinned by `WORLD_ENGINE.lock.json` (local nested-v3 target; compare runtime lock before launch)

## Purpose

Konnaxion consumes the Universe/World runtime but does not own it. This document defines only the
host integration boundary. Canonical Universe/World models, migrations, resolver semantics,
isolation rules, release lifecycle, relations/publications/subscriptions and their detailed
architecture belong to `Konnaxion_Worlds`.

## Repository boundary

The following paths are forbidden in the main Konnaxion repository:

```text
backend/konnaxion/worlds/
docs/Technical-Reference/Worlds/
```

Their presence indicates ownership drift. Run:

```text
python scripts/check_worlds_ownership.py
```

The check MUST fail if either canonical-engine/spec surface reappears locally.

## Allowed Konnaxion host surfaces

Konnaxion MAY own:

- `backend/config/world_adapters.py`: Konnaxion-domain callbacks injected into the engine;
- `backend/config/world_urls.py` and `backend/config/urls.py`: host route mounting;
- host settings selecting adapter callables;
- `backend/config/websocket.py`: product WebSocket integration using the engine's resolver/runtime;
- `frontend/lib/worlds.ts`, `frontend/context/WorldContext.tsx`, and UI switcher components;
- product tests proving that Konnaxion behaves correctly while hosted in a resolved Universe/World context.

These surfaces MUST consume public engine contracts. They MUST NOT reimplement engine models,
migrations, isolation, release management, permissions or canonical topology semantics.

## Python package composition

The main product's `konnaxion` package uses `pkgutil.extend_path` so a separately installed
`konnaxion-worlds` distribution can provide `konnaxion.worlds` without vendoring it into this repo.

Local development expects `Konnaxion_Worlds` beside `Konnaxion`; `RUN_backend_local.bat` first verifies the sibling against `WORLD_ENGINE.lock.json` and then installs its `backend` package in editable mode before running Konnaxion migrations/server startup. The lock pins both package version and a deterministic content-tree digest over the canonical backend package.

Production/capsule packaging must apply the same version/digest identity rather than accepting the first structurally valid sibling. The supplied Capsule Manager source was not part of this update, so its ReleaseSet binding remains a separate required handoff task; Konnaxion itself now exposes the exact expected identity in a machine-readable lock.

## Local nested Universe catalogue and startup (v3)

Canonical source for the Windows `uv` development tree:

```text
../Konnaxion_Worlds/universes/<universe_key>/universe.yaml
../Konnaxion_Worlds/universes/<universe_key>/worlds/<world_key>/world.yaml
```

The same parent directory is configured for
`KONNAXION_UNIVERSE_SEED_ROOT` and `KONNAXION_WORLD_SEED_ROOT` in
`backend/config/settings/local.py` by `INSTALL_NESTED_UNIVERSES.ps1`.
The sibling `Konnaxion_Worlds` engine resolves nested World Packs; Konnaxion
must not reimplement that resolver. The v3 launcher checks its pinned tree
digest and installs the sibling package before migrations and autoload.

`backend/tools/universe_autoload.py` is a **local host bootstrap adapter**, not
a second Universe manager. It validates the catalogue before starting the API
and promotes **only Universe keys absent from the database**. Existing DB keys
are not refreshed, reset, promoted or changed on startup. It is read-only
without `--apply-new`; the launcher defaults to loading new keys unless
`KX_AUTOLOAD_NEW_UNIVERSES=0`. No watcher or live reload of new directories is
promised while the backend is already running.

The live UI obtains Universes/Worlds through Django control-plane endpoints,
with authentication, visibility and permissions. A private Universe/World can
exist and be active in the database without appearing in the anonymous browser
menu. The Manager lists filesystem packs and installed DB Universes **as
separate inventories**.

See `UNIVERSES_NESTED_LOCAL_V3.md` for the local operating procedure. The
older host `backend/seed-data/universes` and `backend/seed-data/worlds` trees
are migration sources/historical copies, not the nested-v3 runtime authority.
Production and Capsule Manager migration require separate qualification.

## Host-domain adapters

The standalone engine must not import Konnaxion product domains such as ethiKos or EkoH directly.
Konnaxion provides configured adapters for host-owned behavior, currently including:

- scenario import into a pinned WorldRelease;
- Konnaxion-owned auxiliary fixture checksum/loading.

Adapter code remains product-owned because it knows product-domain models. Engine code remains
standalone because it invokes adapters only through configured dotted-callable contracts.

## Runtime/navigation contract

Target product route:

```text
/u/{universe_key}/w/{world_key}/...
```

Phase-U1 World-only routes may remain for compatibility while World keys are globally unique.
The frontend must treat the active context as at least:

```text
Universe + World + WorldRelease
```

and discard stale responses whose `X-Konnaxion-Universe`, `X-Konnaxion-World` or
`X-Konnaxion-World-Release` headers disagree with the current context.

Changing Universe/World is navigation only. Konnaxion host UI MUST NOT trigger seed import,
build, migration, reset, release promotion or schema provisioning as a side effect of switching.

### Universe subdomain adapter

Production may expose an Universe through an explicit hostname while retaining
the canonical path/API contracts:

```text
unesco.konnaxion.com/w/unesco-ocean/
levis.konnaxion.com/w/levis-finances/
```

The adapter is generic:

```text
<subdomain>.konnaxion.com -> Universe.key == <subdomain>
```

The browser shell derives the Universe from the configured base domain, while
World identity remains in the path. API requests continue to use the canonical
`/api/u/{universe_key}/w/{world_key}/...` contract internally.

If a hostname-selected Universe and an explicit `/u/{universe_key}/...` path
disagree, the request fails closed. No Universe-specific code, database,
container, or reverse-proxy instance is created.

For the current production setup, DNS records are explicit rather than
wildcard: each public Universe hostname aliases `konnaxion.com`, and Traefik
receives the same explicit host list for routing and ordinary ACME certificates.

## Change rule

If a requested change alters any of these concepts, implement/specify it first in `Konnaxion_Worlds`:

- Universe/World/WorldRelease data model;
- memberships and access semantics;
- route resolution or runtime pinning;
- schema/cache/task/search/WebSocket/media isolation;
- relation/publication/subscription semantics;
- build/release/snapshot lifecycle;
- canonical architecture locks/invariants.

Only then update Konnaxion's host adapters/navigation to consume the new contract.


### Web UI ownership

The main Konnaxion repository owns the product-shell web integration: `UniverseSwitcher`, `WorldSwitcher`, Next.js route adaptation, and browser response guards. `Konnaxion_Worlds` owns the engine/API contract and MUST NOT carry a second maintained copy of these product UI files. Konnaxion UI code may interpret the contract but MUST NOT recreate engine models, migrations, runtime resolution, or canonical Universe/World specifications.
