# External Integrations

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the system-level rules for connecting kOA to external providers, peers, devices, developer tools, offline transfer media, and external AI surfaces.

An integration extends or connects a locally owned capability across a boundary. It does not become a new source of implicit authority. Every boundary crossing has an explicit identity, purpose, owner, classification, data-flow contract, failure model, offline behavior, removal procedure, and conformance record.

The integration model exists to ensure that:

- external dependencies remain visible and removable;
- data leaves and re-enters through governed paths;
- local component ownership remains intact;
- provider output remains non-authoritative until accepted;
- optional services do not become hidden core dependencies;
- network loss produces safe degradation rather than system collapse;
- approved external AI surfaces remain separate from native functionality;
- federation and offline transfer preserve trust, compatibility, and provenance.

The canonical integration inventory is machine-readable. This document explains the model and its system-wide boundaries.

## 2. Scope

This document applies globally to:

- external AI surfaces;
- external voice adapters;
- external application and infrastructure services;
- federation peers;
- local and remote device adapters;
- controlled imports;
- controlled exports;
- developer tools crossing a system boundary;
- migration sources;
- live network integrations;
- offline transfer media and bundles;
- credentials and provider authentication;
- integration data flows;
- provider callbacks and inbound events;
- retries, queues, reconciliation, and duplicate handling;
- integration removal and replacement;
- external capability and profile conformance claims.

This document governs both Internet-facing and non-Internet boundaries. A local device, offline archive, removable medium, development environment, or federation peer is an integration when it crosses ownership, trust, policy, data, or execution boundaries.

This document does not define provider-specific commercial terms, user-interface layout, endpoint addresses, implementation libraries, or deployment secrets. Those values remain in provider agreements, profile contracts, component contracts, managed configuration, and managed secret stores.

## 3. Canonical References

Canonical ownership is distributed as follows:

| Subject | Canonical owner |
| --- | --- |
| Global integration model | `contracts/system.contract.json#/external_integrations` |
| Integration identity, classification, scope, data flows, and removal behavior | `contracts/integration-types.contract.json` |
| Component identity, responsibility, and data ownership | `generated/component-catalog.json` |
| Publication Gateway behavior | `contracts/components/publication-gateway.component.json` |
| UCKK Publication Bridge behavior | `contracts/integrations/uckk-publication.integration.json` |
| UCKK Import Bridge behavior | `contracts/integrations/uckk-import.integration.json` |
| Shared Mediatheque frame | `contracts/artifact-contracts/shared-mediatheque-frame.schema.json` |
| Ariane Runtime and local navigation | `contracts/components/ariane-runtime.component.json` |
| Profile enablement and deployment conditions | `contracts/profiles/*.profile.json` |
| Artifact classes transferred across boundaries | `contracts/artifact-classes.contract.json` |
| Requirement statements and strength | `generated/requirements-index.json` |
| Cross-file integration invariants | `generated/assertion-index.json` |
| Decision, integration, component, profile, test, and evidence links | `generated/traceability.json` |
| Integration conformance tests | `generated/test-catalog.json` |
| Integration evidence | `generated/evidence-catalog.json` |
| Approved bounded deviations | `generated/exception-index.json` |
| Accepted architectural decisions | `generated/decision-index.json` |
| Active versions and authority order | `generated/authority-manifest.json` |

The integrations registry owns active integration facts. Component contracts own local interfaces and authoritative state. Profile contracts own conditional deployment and enablement. This document explains the rules without becoming a duplicate integration inventory.

## 4. Model and Responsibilities

### 4.1 Integration classes

Every integration uses one canonical classification.

| Classification | Boundary and purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `external_ai_surface` | User-triggered processing by an approved external AI provider |
| `external_voice_adapter` | Optional external processing used for Ariane voice interaction |
| `external_service` | External application, infrastructure, notification, storage, or processing service |
| `federation_peer` | Another governed system exchanging data, artifacts, requests, or evidence |
| `device_adapter` | A local or remote hardware, sensor, capture, playback, or peripheral boundary |
| `controlled_import` | Governed intake of data or artifacts from an external source |
| `controlled_export` | Governed release of data or artifacts to an external destination |
| `developer_tool` | Development, analysis, build, inspection, or testing tool outside the runtime boundary |
| `migration_source` | Frozen historical or baseline source used only for migration and lineage |

Classification determines required controls but does not replace profile or component scope.

### 4.2 Canonical integration record

A canonical integration record contains:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `integration_id` | Stable integration identity |
| `surface_id` | Stable provider or surface identity |
| `classification` | One registered integration class |
| `scope` | Global, profile, overlay, component, artifact, toolchain, or migration scope |
| `provider` | Provider identity and external-boundary status |
| `optionality` | Optional or profile-conditional |
| `owner_ref` | Canonical owner of the integration contract |
| `component_refs` | Participating local components |
| `profile_refs` | Profiles permitted to enable the integration |
| `endpoints` | Boundary, protocol, and address-source declarations |
| `capabilities` | Exposed inbound, outbound, or bidirectional abilities |
| `data_flows` | Explicit data movement and authority effects |
| `authentication` | Identity and managed credential requirements |
| `offline_behavior` | Behavior when the boundary is unavailable |
| `removal_behavior` | Verified behavior after integration removal |
| `governance_controls` | Export, import, provenance, acceptance, and gateway controls |
| `requirement_refs` | Normative obligations |
| `lock_refs` | Alignment constraints |
| `test_refs` | Required conformance tests |
| `evidence_refs` | Current implementation and operational evidence |

Existence of a URL, credential, package, plugin, endpoint, or provider account does not register an integration.

### 4.3 Ownership and authority boundary

The local component that owns the affected authoritative state remains the sole authority for that state.

An integration can:

- submit a request;
- transport an artifact;
- return candidate material;
- report provider status;
- provide evidence;
- deliver a governed import;
- accept a governed export;
- participate in a validated federation exchange.

An integration does not acquire ownership of:

- local component databases;
- local policy decisions;
- local publication state;
- local identity;
- local consent;
- local cultural-rights decisions;
- local activation state;
- local conformance claims.

External acknowledgement and local acceptance are separate transitions.

### 4.4 Endpoint model

An endpoint declares:

- a stable endpoint identity;
- boundary type;
- protocol;
- address source;
- network zone where applicable;
- authentication mechanism;
- expected direction;
- timeout and retry behavior;
- compatibility and version rules.

Addresses come from profile contracts, component contracts, deployment configuration, managed discovery, or offline manifests. They are not hard-coded as canonical architecture facts in explanatory prose.

### 4.5 Capability model

An integration capability identifies:

- the observable purpose;
- inbound, outbound, or bidirectional direction;
- whether the capability is user-visible;
- applicable profiles;
- local owner;
- authority effect;
- dependency on network or provider availability;
- offline and removal behavior.

An external capability remains separate from the local native capability it augments. For example, Ariane local navigation and external voice processing are different capabilities.

### 4.6 Data-flow model

Each data flow identifies:

- source and destination;
- direction;
- data classes;
- purpose;
- authority effect;
- minimization;
- encryption in transit;
- provenance;
- consent requirements;
- retention;
- failure behavior.

The authority effect uses an explicit value such as:

`text
none
candidate_input_only
controlled_import_pending_acceptance
transport_only
evidence_only
authoritative_after_explicit_acceptance
`

`authoritative_after_explicit_acceptance` means that the owning local component evaluates and accepts the object through its canonical contract. It does not grant direct external write authority.

### 4.7 Data classes

The integration registry can classify data as:

`text
public
internal
personal
sensitive_personal
cultural
confidential
operational_metadata
artifact
candidate_content
provenance
evidence
`

Credentials and secret material remain outside ordinary data flows. Managed references identify the credentials required for authentication.

A data class indicates handling needs. It does not itself authorize transfer.

### 4.8 Controlled export

Controlled export separates selection, authorization, transformation, transfer, and confirmation.

An export can require:

- explicit user selection;
- purpose declaration;
- destination validation;
- disclosure or publication authorization;
- consent and cultural-rights evaluation;
- data minimization;
- format conversion;
- integrity and provenance attachment;
- expiration;
- receipt generation;
- remote confirmation.

The Publication Gateway controls governed cross-domain disclosure and publication where its contract applies.

### 4.9 Controlled import

Controlled import separates receipt, quarantine, validation, interpretation, acceptance, and activation.

An inbound object can require:

- provider or source authentication;
- integrity verification;
- malware and content-safety checks;
- schema and compatibility validation;
- provenance preservation;
- data classification;
- policy and consent evaluation;
- owner-component acceptance;
- duplicate detection;
- activation or indexing as a separate transition.

Transporting an object into local storage does not make it authoritative.

### 4.10 Federation

A federation peer is another governed authority domain, not an extension of the local process space.

Federation declares:

- peer identity and trust roots;
- compatible contracts and artifact versions;
- authority and tenancy scope;
- data and disclosure boundaries;
- request and response semantics;
- conflict and reconciliation policy;
- audit and evidence obligations;
- revocation and peer-removal behavior;
- offline and retry behavior.

Local component ownership remains intact even when a peer carries a copy or related state.

### 4.11 Optionality and removal

Every integration is optional or profile-conditional. Removal behavior identifies:

- the removal procedure;
- pending-work disposition;
- local-data preservation;
- credential removal;
- provider-specific state cleanup;
- post-removal capability state;
- fallback or manual workflow;
- conformance impact.

A removable integration cannot be a hidden prerequisite for unrelated core behavior.

### 4.12 Approved external AI surfaces

The approved external AI surface set is:

`text
ChatGPT
Suno
Gamma
approved Ariane voice adapter
`

These surfaces are optional and user-triggered. Their common control path is:

`text
local selection
local authorization
controlled export
external processing
provenance-preserving return
controlled re-import
local review or policy-authorized acceptance
local authoritative action
`

The external result remains candidate material until the local owning workflow accepts it.

ChatGPT can support user-selected external assistance. Suno and Gamma can support user-selected kOA Mediatheque-related creative or presentation workflows. The approved Ariane voice adapter adds optional voice processing while local non-voice navigation remains native and available without it.

No additional provider becomes approved through common usage, installed software, a recipe, a user account, or an implementation shortcut.

### 4.13 UCKK directional interchange

The online UCKK Mediatheque and the private offline kOA Mediatheque use the same declared shared frame or compatible versions. Directional integrations remain separate.

| Boundary | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Publication Gateway | Authorizes outbound disclosure across the authority boundary |
| UCKK Publication Bridge | Packages and transports only the authorized representation to UCKK |
| UCKK Import Bridge | Retrieves selected UCKK learning packages and places them in quarantine |
| kOA Mediatheque | Accepts or rejects validated inbound candidates and creates local identities |
| Governance Policy Runtime | Evaluates import or publication policy when required |

`publish_to_uckk` and `import_from_uckk` have separate selections, credentials, queues, packages, receipts, retries, and reconciliation. Frame compatibility does not create shared authority or background synchronization.

### 4.14 SenTient and developer tools

SenTient is an optional, isolated, non-authoritative workbench for eligible development or build profiles. It is registered as a component and can expose integrations or developer-tool boundaries where applicable.

SenTient, OpenRefine, search engines, language models, build tools, and similar workbenches do not become native user capabilities because they are installed or accessible. Their outputs remain candidate material until accepted through a local authoritative workflow.

12. bind requirements, locks, tests, and evidence;
13. validate the record and all references;
14. activate it through the authority release.

An incomplete record remains unavailable to active profiles.

### 6.2 Enabling an integration

Profile enablement proceeds through:

1. resolve the active integration record;
2. verify profile eligibility;
3. resolve participating component contracts;
4. verify endpoint and provider configuration;
5. provision managed credentials;
6. validate data-flow and governance controls;
7. execute connectivity, failure, removal, and security tests;
8. record current evidence;
9. expose only the registered capabilities.

Provider connectivity alone does not establish enablement.

### 6.3 Outbound operation

A governed outbound operation follows:

`text
requested
scope_checked
destination_checked
data_selected
authority_checked
minimized
protected
provenance_attached
submitted
provider_acknowledged
external_effect_verified
locally_reconciled
completed
`

Alternative states include:

`text
blocked
cancelled
deferred
expired
failed
conflicted
revoked
`

A provider acknowledgement does not skip verification or local reconciliation.

### 6.4 Inbound operation

A governed inbound operation follows:

`text
received
source_authenticated
quarantined
integrity_checked
classified
contract_validated
policy_checked
owner_reviewed
accepted
authoritative_action_executed
evidence_recorded
`

Alternative states include:

`text
rejected
duplicate
incompatible
expired
quarantined
withdrawn
failed
`

The owning component determines authoritative acceptance.

### 6.5 External AI operation

An approved external AI operation follows:

1. the user or authorized workflow selects the task and payload;
2. the local owner verifies scope and permission;
3. the payload is minimized and exported through a controlled boundary;
4. provider interaction occurs outside native authority;
5. returned material receives provider and operation provenance;
6. the result enters a controlled local import path;
7. a human or authorized local workflow reviews the candidate;
8. the owning component records acceptance, rejection, or modification;
9. any subsequent publication, activation, or state change follows its own policy.

A returned response never bypasses the acceptance step.

### 6.6 Retry and reconciliation

Before retrying or reconciling an operation, the system:

1. verifies that the request remains valid;
2. checks expiry and cancellation;
3. re-evaluates current authority and compatibility;
4. detects prior external and local effects;
5. uses idempotency identifiers or duplicate detection;
6. submits only eligible work;
7. preserves remote confirmation;
8. applies the owning component's conflict policy;
9. records final evidence.

Unknown remote outcome remains explicit until verified.

### 6.7 Removing or replacing an integration

Removal proceeds through:

1. stop new invocations;
2. classify pending work;
3. complete, cancel, export, or abandon pending work under policy;
4. preserve locally owned authoritative data;
5. remove or revoke managed credentials;
6. detach endpoints and callbacks;
7. verify that no hidden process continues;
8. execute removal tests;
9. update profile claims and generated context;
10. retain required evidence.

Replacement is a separate registered integration or a compatible versioned evolution with explicit migration and rollback behavior.

## 7. Failure Modes and Safe Degradation

| Failure | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Network unavailable | Preserve local core and expose provider-dependent capabilities as deferred or unavailable. |
| Name resolution fails | Treat affected endpoints as unavailable without uncontrolled retry loops. |
| Authentication fails | Block the integration operation and preserve local authoritative state. |
| Credential reference is absent | Keep the integration disabled; never substitute an embedded credential. |
| Provider rate limit | Queue, delay, or reject according to the registered policy. |
| Timeout with unknown remote outcome | Preserve an indeterminate state and reconcile before retrying. |
| Duplicate callback or delivery | Detect the duplicate before any repeated authoritative effect. |
| Provider response is malformed | Quarantine or reject it before local acceptance. |
| Response is incompatible | Block import and preserve evidence for migration or forward repair. |
| Integrity verification fails | Reject or quarantine the object and prevent activation. |
| External AI surface unavailable | Disable only the associated optional adapter capability. |
| Ariane voice unavailable | Preserve Ariane local non-voice navigation. |
| Suno or Gamma unavailable | Preserve native kOA Mediatheque ingestion, organization, indexing, retrieval, export, backup, and restore. |
| Publication Gateway unavailable | Block or defer every new UCKK publication request before packaging or transport. |
| UCKK Publication Bridge unavailable | Block or defer UCKK publication transport without granting Publication Gateway replacement authority. |
| Federation peer unavailable | Preserve local authority and queue only operations registered as safely deferrable. |
| Offline media invalid | Reject import without changing active local state. |
| Removal test fails | Block the removal or profile conformance claim until the dependency is eliminated. |
| Integration registry unavailable or invalid | Block new activation and configuration changes; preserve already validated local core behavior. |

Safe degradation is integration-specific. Failure at one boundary does not authorize another component or gateway to assume its responsibility.

## 8. Security, Privacy, and Trust Boundaries

Integrations cross at least one trust, ownership, policy, network, data, or execution boundary. They therefore use explicit controls.

Security and privacy controls include:

- authenticated provider, peer, device, source, and destination identities;
- managed credential references;
- encrypted transport where the boundary requires it;
- minimized payloads;
- purpose and destination limitation;
- data classification;
- consent and cultural-rights checks;
- disclosure and publication authorization;
- provenance preservation;
- integrity and compatibility verification;
- inbound quarantine;
- duplicate and replay protection;
- bounded retention;
- access and transfer receipts;
- provider-removal and credential-revocation procedures;
- no secret material in ordinary logs or exports;
- no automatic external AI transfer;
- no direct external write to local authority.

An integration record distinguishes provider authentication from user authorization. Successful provider authentication does not prove that a user, component, or workflow is authorized to transfer a specific object.

External providers are not trusted to classify local authority, consent, publication rights, cultural permissions, conformance, or final acceptance.

Federation trust is bounded by explicit peer identity, contract version, scope, and revocation state. It is not transitive by default.

## 9. Exceptions and Compatibility

A bounded exception can adjust:

- a deployment endpoint;
- an authentication mechanism;
- a temporary provider version;
- an evidence source;
- a retry interval;
- a retention period;
- a profile-specific availability claim;
- an implementation adapter.

An exception cannot:

- register an otherwise unregistered integration implicitly;
- add an external AI surface outside the approved set;
- create native AI capability;
- authorize direct external writes to local authoritative sources;
- permit secrets in ordinary data flows;
- remove controlled import, export, provenance, or acceptance for external AI;
- make optional provider failure disable the local core;
- merge Publication Gateway with UCKK Publication Bridge;
- make Ariane local navigation depend on external voice;
- make SenTient authoritative;
- authorize a false conformance claim.

Compatibility applies to:

- endpoint protocols;
- request and response schemas;
- artifact classes and versions;
- provider identifiers;
- federation contracts;
- trust roots;
- data classifications;
- authority effects;
- receipt formats;
- idempotency semantics;
- offline bundles;
- removal and migration procedures.

An incompatible integration remains blocked until a validated rollback, migration, adapter, or forward repair exists. Unknown fields or provider behavior are not interpreted through agent inference.

## 11. Non-Normative Examples

### 11.1 ChatGPT-assisted drafting

A user selects local text and invokes the registered ChatGPT adapter. The export is minimized and records purpose and provenance. The returned text is candidate material. The user edits and explicitly accepts it before the owning component records a local authoritative version.

### 11.2 Suno in a kOA Mediatheque workflow

A user selects an eligible kOA Mediatheque media record and invokes Suno. Native kOA Mediatheque retains ownership of the source object and its local metadata. The returned audio is imported as candidate content with provider provenance and is accepted separately.

### 11.3 Gamma presentation generation

A user exports selected, authorized material to Gamma for a presentation draft. Gamma does not gain access to unrelated kOA Mediatheque or component data. The returned presentation remains a candidate artifact until locally reviewed and accepted.

### 11.4 Ariane voice loss

The approved Ariane voice adapter becomes unavailable. Voice interaction is disabled. Ariane's local non-voice navigation remains available and does not attempt to substitute an unapproved provider.

### 11.5 Publication Gateway

A component requests governed publication. The Publication Gateway evaluates the applicable disclosure path and records the external effect. It does not become the owner of the component's source content.

### 11.6 UCKK Publication Bridge

A user selects a local kOA Mediatheque record for publication to an external UCKK Moodle destination. Publication Gateway authorizes the disclosure, then UCKK Publication Bridge validates, packages, and transports the approved representation. It does not own local media or acquire general publication authority.

### 11.7 UCKK Import Bridge

A school selects an UCKK course for offline use. The UCKK Import Bridge retrieves or receives a complete learning package, quarantines it, verifies source, license, integrity, provenance, required resources, and frame compatibility, then presents it for local acceptance. The kOA Mediatheque creates separate local identities and keeps the accepted material available without Internet access.

### 11.8 Federation retry

A federation request times out after submission. The local system preserves the unknown remote outcome and reconciles by idempotency identifier before retrying. It does not report success or submit a duplicate effect blindly.

### 11.9 Offline import bundle

A sovereign offline node receives a signed transfer bundle. The controlled import validates the manifest, integrity, compatibility, provenance, and target ownership before any local activation.

### 11.10 Provider removal

An optional notification provider is removed. Pending notifications are cancelled or exported according to policy, credentials are revoked, and local authoritative records remain intact. Unrelated local capabilities continue.

### 11.11 Developer tool

A developer profile uses an external analysis tool. The tool receives only workspace-scoped data, cannot write to runtime authoritative stores, and produces candidate findings that require local review.

## Final resilience contract

Every active external integration binds an `integration_resilience_policy`. An asynchronous integration also binds dead-letter behavior. A multi-owner operation binds a distributed workflow. A transfer above the active inline limit binds a large payload reference. These requirements apply to `publish_to_uckk` and `import_from_uckk` and preserve local authority while the remote platform is unavailable.

## Koali product UI modularity

This document is interpreted with the Koali product-interface portability rule:

- each independently packaged product owns its user interface and remains independently operable when its declared standalone mode is supported;
- shared Koali shell and design-system code is reusable presentation infrastructure, not a mandatory product runtime and not a source of business authority;
- an integrated composition host discovers installed and admitted product manifests dynamically rather than hard-coding a mandatory product list;
- a surface profile is a projection of the same product routes, capabilities, commands, and contextual views, not a separately implemented frontend;
- removing one product removes only that product's admitted presentation contributions and SHALL NOT require source changes to unrelated products;
- ordinary shell behavior SHALL NOT require private UI imports from another product; cross-product journeys use explicit public routes, commands, capabilities, or integration contracts.
