# Cross-Component Communication

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how active kOA components communicate without weakening component separation, canonical data ownership, explicit authority, offline continuity, or safe degradation.

It establishes the system-wide communication model for:

- synchronous commands and queries;
- asynchronous jobs and results;
- domain events and subscriptions;
- immutable artifact transfer;
- controlled read models;
- gateways and brokers;
- policy and resource-control interactions;
- external integration adapters;
- retries, replay, compatibility, observability, and evidence.

The intended outcome is deterministic routing of every interaction through an explicit contract while ensuring that transport, orchestration, caching, indexing, projection, and coordination never become implicit authority.

Canonical component identities, responsibilities, interfaces, data ownership, integration definitions, requirements, and locks remain owned by their referenced registries and contracts. This document explains how those facts apply across component boundaries.

## 2. Scope

This document applies globally to every interaction in which one component communicates with:

- another first-class kOA component;
- a component-owned worker or adapter;
- Publication Gateway;
- UCKK Publication Bridge;
- UCKK Import Bridge;
- Governance Policy Runtime;
- Resource Governor;
- Audit Broker;
- Identity and Trust;
- kOA Node Agent or the privileged broker path;
- an external integration;
- a generated or immutable artifact consumer;
- a controlled read model or projection.

It governs runtime and lifecycle communication over:

- local process interfaces;
- loopback or internal network APIs;
- message queues and event transports;
- job queues;
- Unix-domain or equivalent local sockets;
- immutable files and artifact stores;
- import and export packages;
- controlled database projections;
- profile-declared service meshes or orchestration networks;
- offline transfer media.

This document does not prescribe a universal transport technology, serialization library, message broker, API framework, service mesh, container network, or database process layout.

A profile or recipe may select a transport or deployment mechanism only within its declared scope. Such a selection does not change the global ownership and authority rules in this document.

Internal calls within one component are outside cross-component scope unless they cross an authority, privilege, data-owner, disclosure, release, or independently versioned contract boundary.

## 4. Model and Responsibilities

### 4.1 Communication boundary

A communication boundary exists when information or intent crosses between independently owned component contracts, authority domains, privilege domains, data domains, release units, or integration boundaries.

Every boundary has:

- a declared sender;
- a declared receiving owner;
- a versioned interface or artifact contract;
- a permitted interaction class;
- an authority and policy evaluation point;
- payload and metadata rules;
- failure and retry behavior;
- compatibility rules;
- observable results;
- applicable evidence requirements.

The receiving component remains responsible for deciding whether and how its owned state changes.

### 4.2 Interaction classes

| Interaction class | Purpose | Authority effect | Canonical owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Command | Requests a state-changing operation | No effect until accepted and committed by the receiving owner | Receiving component contract |
| Query | Requests a projection or current view | Does not transfer source ownership | Serving component contract |
| Domain event | Announces an already committed fact | Provides evidence of a fact; does not authorize the original mutation | Publishing component contract |
| Asynchronous job | Requests deferred work with observable status and result | Result becomes authoritative only through the owning component's declared commit path | Job-owning component contract |
| Artifact transfer | Transfers immutable or versioned content | Authority depends on validation and activation under the artifact contract | Artifact contract and receiving component |
| Controlled read model | Provides a derived view for declared consumers | Remains non-authoritative unless explicitly assigned ownership | Source owner plus read-model contract |
| Policy decision request | Requests authorization, disclosure, consent, or privilege evaluation | Policy result authorizes only the declared capability and scope | Governance Policy Runtime contract where deployed |
| Resource request | Requests scheduling or resource allocation | Does not authorize business, disclosure, or privilege actions | Resource Governor contract |
| Gateway transfer | Crosses a declared disclosure, ingestion, publication, or privilege boundary | Limited to gateway contract and upstream authority | Gateway or broker contract |
| External integration call | Invokes a removable external capability | External result remains non-authoritative until accepted by the receiving component | Integration contract and receiving component |

### 4.3 Contract ownership

The receiving component owns:

- accepted operations;
- validation rules for its authoritative state;
- transaction boundaries;
- idempotency semantics;
- emitted domain events;
- result and error representations;
- compatibility commitments;
- rejection and degradation behavior.

The sender owns:

- the correctness of its request construction;
- its actor and subject context;
- its local retry behavior;
- its handling of accepted, rejected, blocked, delayed, and unknown outcomes;
- any mutation of its own state caused by the result.

A transport owns delivery mechanics only. It does not own business authority, data semantics, or authorization.

### 4.3.1 Interaction Kernel adoption boundary

Interaction Kernel (IK) can be used as a system-of-systems interoperability protocol at declared subsystem boundaries, but it does not replace the canonical kOA-Linux component/subsystem contracts. The Kristal v6 integration is an explicit adopted boundary: `kristal.build.request`, `kristal.artifact.ready`, and `kristal.revision.request` are pinned at IK profile version `2.0.0` under `contracts/integrations/interaction-kernel/kristal/`. This adoption is limited to the Kristal boundary and is not a global IK replacement.

When an accepted integration contract explicitly adopts an IK Profile:

- the IK `command`, `query`, and `event` classes map onto the corresponding kOA-Linux interaction classes in this document;
- the receiving kOA-Linux component or subsystem still performs local authentication, authorization, admission, compatibility checks, and domain commit;
- IK receipts or delivery status do not replace the receiving owner's domain state or kOA-Linux critical-transition receipts;
- ArtifactRef/Export-style references do not transfer artifact or business ownership;
- Kristal-facing IK Profiles terminate at a declared adapter/ACL boundary before Kristal-native contracts are invoked;
- existing kOA-Linux integration contracts remain canonical until change control explicitly registers the IK Profile and its mapping.

Therefore documentation may describe IK as a **target or adopted integration protocol only where a concrete contract says so**. A reference to IK in ecosystem documentation must not be interpreted as a silent global replacement for `contracts/integration-types.contract.json`, component contracts, subsystem contracts, or artifact contracts.

### 4.4 Communication envelope

A component contract identifies the fields required by each interface. Cross-boundary messages and artifacts provide enough information to resolve:

- interface or artifact identity and version;
- message, request, job, event, or artifact identity;
- sender and intended receiver;
- operation, query, event, or artifact type;
- actor and subject context when applicable;
- authority, policy, consent, or delegation references when applicable;
- target scope;
- correlation and causal context;
- idempotency or replay identity when applicable;
- payload schema or media type;
- creation and expiration information when time-bounded;
- compatibility and release context;
- trace and evidence context;
- expected response or completion channel.

Sensitive credentials and governed payload fields are not copied into metadata unless the contract explicitly requires and protects them.

### 4.5 Commands and transactions

A command is an expression of intent, not proof of authority and not proof of completion.

The receiving owner:

1. authenticates the caller or verifies the trusted component identity;
2. validates requested capability and target scope;
3. evaluates policy, consent, privilege, compatibility, and preconditions;
4. validates payload and idempotency state;
5. performs one owned transaction or records an accepted deferred job;
6. emits the declared result, event, and evidence;
7. exposes a recovery path when the final outcome cannot be confirmed.

A sender never updates the receiver's authoritative storage as a shortcut.

### 4.6 Queries and read models

A query returns a declared projection of owned state.

The response identifies, where relevant:

- source owner;
- projection contract;
- applicable authorization;
- observation or snapshot point;
- freshness or staleness semantics;
- pagination or continuation semantics;
- filtering and redaction;
- source version or release context.

A cache, index, search projection, analytics table, or user-interface model remains derived. Rebuilding it from canonical sources does not require ownership transfer.

### 4.7 Events

A domain event represents a fact committed by the publishing owner.

The event contract defines:

- event identity and version;
- publisher and owned domain;
- event meaning;
- payload schema;
- ordering scope;
- replay and duplicate behavior;
- retention or expiration;
- authorization and disclosure class;
- consumer compatibility;
- evidence requirements.

A consumer uses the event to update only its own state or to request a separate command from another owner.

### 4.8 Artifacts

Immutable artifacts cross component boundaries when a stable, inspectable, replayable, or offline-transferable representation is preferable to direct runtime calls.

The receiving component validates artifact identity, producer, schema, compatibility, scope, integrity mechanism, policy, and activation eligibility before use.

An artifact can carry data or executable content without granting itself authority to activate.

### 4.9 Gateways, brokers, and coordinators

A gateway or broker is an explicit boundary component, not a universal bypass.

- Publication Gateway governs declared cross-domain disclosure and publication.
- UCKK Publication Bridge packages and transports Publication-Gateway-authorized media to an external UCKK Moodle destination.
- UCKK Import Bridge retrieves selected learning packages into quarantine, validates their declared source, licence, integrity, provenance, and frame compatibility, and submits them to the kOA Mediatheque for explicit local acceptance.
- The privileged broker path performs allowlisted host mutations for applicable profiles.
- Integration adapters isolate external providers.
- A coordinator may orchestrate a multi-component workflow but does not become the owner of participating components' state.

### 4.10 Communication topology

The global model permits direct contract calls, queued interactions, event publication, artifact exchange, and gateway-mediated transfer.

The permitted topology for a concrete profile is declared by profile and component contracts. Physical consolidation in a lightweight profile does not collapse logical boundaries. Physical separation in a sovereign or high-assurance profile does not create new semantic owners.

## 5. Applicable Normative Requirements

## 6. Communication Procedure and State Transitions

### 6.1 Contract resolution

Before communication begins, the initiating component resolves:

1. the intended receiving component;
2. the active component contract;
3. the interaction class;
4. the interface or artifact version;
5. the active profile and overlays;
6. applicable authority, policy, consent, security, and integration rules;
7. required compatibility and release constraints;
8. expected result, failure, and evidence behavior.

If the receiver, owner, contract, version, or scope cannot be resolved, the interaction is blocked.

### 6.2 Request construction

The sender constructs the request using the receiving contract.

The sender includes only the required payload and metadata, validates local syntax, applies data minimization, and records correlation information.

For retryable mutations, the sender creates or reuses the declared idempotency identity. A new retry identity is not created merely because the response was lost.

### 6.3 Transport admission

The selected transport verifies the declared channel, receiver, size, encoding, authentication mechanism, and transport-level limits.

Transport admission does not imply business acceptance.

A queued message can be durably admitted while the requested business operation is later rejected.

### 6.4 Receiving validation

The receiving component validates:

- caller or component identity;
- interface and payload version;
- target and scope;
- actor and subject authority;
- policy and consent;
- component ownership;
- compatibility;
- idempotency or replay state;
- rate, resource, and operational limits;
- required dependencies.

A validation failure returns or records the declared rejection without mutation.

### 6.5 Execution

For an accepted synchronous command, the receiving owner performs the operation within its declared transaction boundary.

For an asynchronous job, the owner records an accepted job identity and exposes declared status, completion, cancellation, and terminal-failure behavior.

For a query, the owner returns the authorized projection without mutation unless the contract explicitly declares a harmless derived-cache update.

For an artifact, the receiver stages and validates the artifact before activation or import.

### 6.6 Commit and publication

After successful owned-state commit, the component may:

- return a result;
- publish a domain event;
- update a controlled read model;
- produce an immutable artifact;
- emit a critical-transition receipt;
- schedule follow-up work.

Events and receipts describe the committed outcome. They do not replace the commit or create retrospective authority.

### 6.7 Confirmation

The sender handles one of the declared outcomes:

- completed;
- accepted for deferred work;
- rejected;
- blocked;
- expired;
- cancelled;
- failed with known final state;
- indeterminate outcome requiring status resolution.

The sender does not assume completion from transport success or timeout.

### 6.8 Retry and replay

Retry follows the receiving contract.

A retry preserves correlation and idempotency identity. The receiving owner either returns the prior result, continues the existing job, or safely performs the operation once.

Event replay is explicitly marked and remains subject to schema, authorization, consumer version, and duplicate-handling rules.

### 6.9 Coordinated multi-component workflow

A coordinator performs these steps:

1. records the workflow identity and intended participants;
2. resolves each owner and contract independently;
3. submits owned operations in declared order;
4. records each component result;
5. applies compensation or forward repair only through component contracts;
6. reports partial completion explicitly;
7. emits workflow evidence without claiming ownership of participant state.

A distributed workflow is not represented as atomic unless the active contracts define and test an atomic protocol.

## 7. Failure States and Safe Degradation

| Failure condition | Required behavior | Permitted degradation | Prohibited behavior | Evidence |

Safe degradation is scoped to the failed capability. It does not create a new owner, transport, policy decision, consent grant, integration, or mutation path.

## 8. Cross-Component Interaction Patterns

### 8.1 Command pattern

Use a command when one component asks another owner to perform a mutation.

`text
sender
 -> versioned command contract
 -> receiving owner validates authority and payload
 -> receiving owner commits its own state
 -> result + optional event + required receipt
`

The sender holds intent. The receiver holds mutation authority.

### 8.2 Query pattern

Use a query when one component needs an authorized projection from another owner.

`text
consumer
 -> versioned query contract
 -> source owner applies authorization and redaction
 -> projection with freshness and source context
`

The consumer does not gain source ownership.

### 8.3 Domain-event pattern

Use an event when a committed fact can inform multiple consumers without coupling the publisher to each consumer's internal operation.

`text
publisher commits owned fact
 -> publisher emits versioned event
 -> consumers validate event and update only their own state
`

Consumer failure does not undo the publisher's committed fact unless a separate workflow contract explicitly defines compensation.

### 8.4 Deferred-job pattern

Use a job when work is long-running, resource-sensitive, cancellable, or unsuitable for a synchronous timeout.

The job-owning component provides:

- a stable job identity;
- admission result;
- status;
- progress semantics when applicable;
- cancellation rules;
- terminal result;
- retry and expiration behavior;
- evidence for critical outcomes.

Resource Governor may schedule the job. Governance Policy Runtime may authorize it. Neither substitutes for the job-owning component.

### 8.5 Artifact-exchange pattern

Use an artifact for offline transfer, reproducible input, staged activation, large media, compiled language assets, Kristal packages, release bundles, or other immutable representations.

The artifact is produced under its owner contract and consumed under the receiver contract. Validation precedes import or activation.

### 8.6 Controlled-read-model pattern

Use a controlled read model when repeated queries require a projection optimized for a declared consumer.

The model records:

- source owners;
- derivation path;
- freshness and rebuild semantics;
- access controls;
- scope and retention;
- non-authoritative status.

A shared read model does not become a shared write surface.

### 8.7 Governed-publication pattern

Use Publication Gateway when information crosses a governed disclosure or publication boundary.

The source owner selects or authorizes the content. Governance Policy Runtime may return a disclosure decision where deployed. Publication Gateway validates the transfer contract, applies the declared publication controls, and records the result.

UCKK Publication Bridge remains the target-specific packaging and transport boundary and does not replace the governed publication pattern.

### 8.8 Privileged-host-mutation pattern

A component requesting a governed host mutation sends a narrowly defined request through the approved policy and privileged-broker path for the active profile.

The broker performs only allowlisted operations and returns a structured result. No ordinary component uses host privilege as a general communication mechanism.

### 8.9 External-integration pattern

An integration adapter:

1. receives an explicit capability-scoped request;
2. authenticates to the declared provider;
3. transfers only declared data;
4. records provider and version context where available;
5. returns a result to the receiving component;
6. permits removal without breaking unrelated local communication.

External results remain candidate input until accepted by the component that owns the affected state.

### 8.10 Audit and evidence pattern

Critical transitions emit evidence through declared contracts.

Evidence includes enough context to verify the transition without duplicating unrestricted governed payloads. Audit and evidence transport does not grant the audit path authority over source component state.

## 9. Decision Closure and Prohibited Assumptions

This document is supported by the accepted decisions declared in its metadata.

A semantic change to the communication model requires:

1. an accepted owner decision;
2. identification of affected components, data owners, interfaces, profiles, integrations, artifacts, release channels, security controls, tests, evidence, and documents;
3. direct and transitive impact analysis;
4. compatible contract and schema updates;
5. coordinated version transition when compatibility cannot be preserved;
6. complete validation before authority activation.

The following assumptions are prohibited:

- components may communicate through a shared database because they run in one process or on one host;
- read access implies write authority;
- a transport-level identity is sufficient business authorization;
- message delivery proves business completion;
- timeout proves failure;
- retry with a new identity is safe for a mutation;
- event arrival order is a global business order;
- an event authorizes the mutation that produced it;
- a consumer may update the publisher's state during replay;
- a cache, search index, materialized view, analytics table, or user-interface projection is authoritative by default;
- orchestration transfers ownership to the coordinator;
- a service mesh, queue, API gateway, database, or workflow engine becomes a policy authority;
- physical database consolidation removes logical ownership boundaries;
- physical separation creates new semantic boundaries not present in contracts;
- Publication Gateway and UCKK Publication Bridge are interchangeable;
- UCKK Publication Bridge and UCKK Import Bridge share one queue, state machine, credential, or automatic synchronization loop;
- Resource Governor can grant authorization or Governance Policy Runtime can allocate resources;
- external integration success creates authority;
- external AI output is trusted component output;
- privileged host mutation can be performed directly by an application component;
- backward compatibility can be inferred without tests;
- a recipe-selected transport is a global requirement;
- logging a request is equivalent to producing required transition evidence;
- missing evidence may be reconstructed from informal logs and treated as canonical.

No active exception currently weakens a requirement in this document.

## 10. Validation Criteria

This document is conformant when all of the following checks pass:

1. It is registered as `DOC-SYS-007`, classed as `normative_markdown`, active, English, and globally scoped.
2. Every canonical reference resolves to an active object.
3. Every declared decision is accepted and applicable.
4. Every declared requirement is unique, active, globally scoped, and mapped to validation.
5. Every declared lock exists and its applicable assertions pass.
6. Every active component contract declares its observable inbound and outbound interfaces.
7. Every state-changing interface identifies the receiving authoritative owner.
8. No component has direct write access to another component's authoritative tables, files, private queues, or internal mutable state.
9. Commands, queries, events, jobs, artifacts, gateways, and read models have unambiguous contract classes.
10. Retryable mutations have tested idempotency behavior.
11. Asynchronous interfaces declare and test delivery, ordering, retry, expiration, cancellation, duplicate, and terminal-failure behavior.
12. Domain events map to committed publisher facts and do not replace mutation authorization.
13. Read models declare source ownership, freshness, rebuild, authorization, and non-authoritative status.
14. UCKK interchange tests separately prove Publication Gateway authorization and outbound transport, inbound quarantine and validation, explicit local acceptance, distinct receipts, offline availability, and preservation of both authorities.
15. Resource Governor and Governance Policy Runtime remain separate in interfaces and authority.
16. External integrations remain removable and data-transfer-scoped.
17. External AI outputs cannot directly mutate authoritative state.
18. Privileged host mutations use the approved broker path for applicable profiles.
19. Critical transitions map to required receipts and evidence.
20. Interface changes either preserve tested compatibility or use a coordinated release transition.
21. Communication failure tests verify fail-closed mutation and capability-scoped degradation.
22. Logs, traces, metrics, errors, terminal-failure records, and receipts comply with minimization, retention, and disclosure rules.
23. Two supported components can be independently restarted, delayed, retried, or upgraded within declared compatibility without creating duplicate or unauthorized state.
24. No recipe, example, deployment topology, or transport technology silently becomes global authority.
25. The active text contains the complete required section structure and no placeholder or undecided implementation state.

## 11. Non-Normative Examples

### Example 1 — Orgo requests a Konnaxion operation

Orgo sends a versioned command to Konnaxion with actor, scope, correlation, and idempotency context.

Konnaxion validates the request and changes only Konnaxion-owned state. Orgo records the result in Orgo-owned workflow state. Neither component writes directly to the other's tables.

### Example 2 — kOA Mediatheque publishes a committed media event

kOA Mediatheque commits a deterministic media-ingestion result and emits a versioned domain event.

A consumer validates the event and updates its own index. Replaying the event rebuilds the consumer's derived state but does not re-ingest or republish the source media.

### Example 3 — Controlled read model

A lightweight profile uses one PostgreSQL process for efficiency.

Konnaxion and Orgo still use separate logical ownership boundaries. A declared read model exposes selected Konnaxion fields to Orgo. Database-process consolidation does not permit direct cross-schema writes.

### Example 4 — Publication boundary

A user selects kOA Mediatheque media for governed publication.

Publication Gateway first evaluates and records the disclosure authorization. UCKK Publication Bridge then packages and transports the approved representation to the external UCKK platform. In the reverse direction, UCKK Import Bridge retrieves a selected learning package into quarantine and the kOA Mediatheque creates a distinct local copy only after validation and explicit acceptance. Neither operation overwrites the other side automatically.

### Example 5 — Resource-sensitive job

kOA Mediatheque submits a thumbnail job to its own worker and requests scheduling from Resource Governor.

Resource Governor controls resource allocation. kOA Mediatheque owns the job, result, and authoritative derivative relationship. Governance Policy Runtime is consulted only when a policy decision is required.

### Example 6 — External AI candidate output

A user explicitly sends selected content through an approved external AI adapter.

The adapter returns candidate output to the receiving component. The receiving workflow validates user acceptance, scope, policy, and payload before any owned-state mutation. The adapter cannot write directly to the component store.

### Example 7 — Lost synchronous response

A command commits successfully, but the response is lost.

The sender queries status or retries with the same idempotency identity. The receiver returns the original result rather than applying the mutation again.

### Example 8 — Incompatible event consumer

A consumer cannot process a newly introduced event version.

The event is retained or routed according to the declared terminal-failure policy. The consumer does not reinterpret unsupported fields or silently discard a critical event. The compatibility failure blocks the affected consumer capability, not the publisher's committed fact.

## Final architecture-pattern composition

Cross-component communication applies the pattern contract as follows:

- remote request-response paths use timeout budgets, backoff with jitter, and circuit breakers;
- asynchronous paths use idempotent consumers, bounded retry, monitored dead-letter quarantine, and redrive evidence;
- local commits that emit external work use Transactional Outbox or an equivalent atomic owner mechanism;
- multi-owner transitions use a persisted distributed workflow with compensation or forward repair;
- large objects remain in owner storage and messages carry large payload references;
- read projections and caches remain non-authoritative and command-free.
