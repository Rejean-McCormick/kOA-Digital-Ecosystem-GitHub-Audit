# Offline Behavior

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the global offline behavior of the kOA-Linux Operating System.

Offline operation is a normal supported state, not an exceptional recovery mode. The native system remains useful when Internet access, external AI surfaces, remote synchronization, remote publication targets, online update services, or other external dependencies are unavailable.

The offline contract has five objectives:

1. preserve local user work and authoritative local data;
2. preserve deterministic native capabilities that have all required local artifacts;
3. disable or narrow only the capabilities that depend on unavailable external services;
4. prevent connectivity loss from creating implicit authority, unsafe fallback, partial publication, or silent data loss;
5. make reconnection a controlled transition with revalidation rather than an automatic replay of stale intent.

The canonical capability model, offline boundary, operating modes, degradation model, and external-service classification are owned by `contracts/system.contract.json`. Component responsibilities are owned by `generated/component-catalog.json`. The normative statements rendered in this document are owned by `generated/requirements-index.json`.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Global applicability

This document applies to:

- all active kOA deployment profiles and profile overlays;
- user and developer operating modes;
- local services and component runtimes;
- local data stores, queues, caches, indexes, and artifact stores;
- local authentication and trust evaluation;
- Ariane guidance and automation;
- kOA Mediatheque ingestion, storage, versioning, and deterministic media processing;
- Kristal and language runtime consumption of installed artifacts;
- local Orgo and Konnaxion capabilities;
- Resource Governor decisions;
- Governance Policy Runtime where a profile deploys it;
- Publication Gateway and other governed transfer paths;
- external integrations, including approved external AI surfaces;
- backup, restore, diagnostics, audit, update, synchronization, and recovery behavior;
- reconnect processing after external availability returns.

### 2.2 Meaning of offline

For this document, offline means that a deployment cannot rely on one or more external network services required by an optional capability.

Offline can result from:

- no physical network;
- no Internet route;
- unavailable name resolution;
- blocked outbound policy;
- unavailable external provider;
- failed authentication to an external provider;
- expired or unavailable remote authorization;
- an intentionally isolated profile;
- a local-only operating policy;
- a temporary outage affecting only one integration.

The system does not treat all network loss as equivalent. A local network can remain available while the Internet is unavailable. One provider can be unavailable while another remains reachable. Capability evaluation uses the exact dependency that is unavailable.

### 2.3 Native capability boundary

A native capability is part of the local kOA execution boundary and has a defined offline behavior.

A capability is not native merely because:

- its interface appears inside a kOA application;
- a browser can display it;
- an external provider has been configured;
- a recipe demonstrates it;
- a developer workstation can reach it;
- a previous result has been cached;
- an external AI response is shown in a local workflow.

ChatGPT, Suno, Gamma, and the external voice-understanding path used by Ariane are optional external surfaces. Their unavailability does not make the native system unavailable.

### 2.4 Profile-specific strengthening

A profile can strengthen the global offline baseline by requiring:

- complete network isolation;
- offline update bundles;
- local trust roots;
- local policy evaluation;
- longer autonomous operation;
- locally available recovery media;
- stricter outbound queue controls;
- stronger evidence for imported artifacts;
- local mirrors or package repositories;
- local time and identity services.

A profile-specific strengthening remains inside that profile or overlay unless an accepted decision promotes it globally.

### 2.5 Non-goals

This document does not:

- guarantee that every optional integration works without its provider;
- guarantee remote synchronization while remote endpoints are unavailable;
- make external AI local or native;
- require a local AI substitute;
- guarantee fresh remote data while disconnected;
- authorize queued publication merely because connectivity returns;
- define one universal network topology;
- require every deployment to host every component;
- define a universal maximum offline duration;
- make SenTient part of the native baseline;
- allow stale identity, consent, policy, trust, or time data to be treated as current without an applicable rule;
- turn cached external output into canonical authority;
- make a recipe or a profile implementation choice a global requirement.

## 3. Canonical References

| Canonical reference | Ownership applied by this document |
| --- | --- |
| `contracts/system.contract.json` | Global offline principle, operating modes, capability classifications, external AI boundary, degradation behavior, reconnection policy, and profile applicability. |
| `generated/component-catalog.json` | Component identity, responsibility, dependencies, authoritative data ownership, and allowed interaction boundaries. |
| `generated/requirements-index.json` | Normative requirement statements, strength, scope, source decisions, validation methods, and linked controls. |

The decision and lock identifiers in the metadata resolve through the active authority release. This document explains their system-level effect without redefining their canonical content.

Profile contracts can strengthen the baseline for a named profile. Component contracts can define narrower behavior for a component. Neither can silently weaken the global offline guarantees or broaden an external capability into the native baseline.

## 4. Model and Responsibilities

### 4.1 Offline capability model

Each capability has an explicit dependency envelope. The envelope identifies:

- local executable dependencies;
- local data dependencies;
- installed artifact dependencies;
- local identity and trust dependencies;
- policy dependencies;
- external network dependencies;
- external provider dependencies;
- time-sensitive authority dependencies;
- optional acceleration dependencies;
- queueing and replay behavior;
- degraded behavior;
- unavailable behavior;
- recovery and reconnection behavior.

A capability remains available offline when every dependency required for that capability is locally satisfied.

A capability narrows when a non-critical dependency is unavailable but a safe local subset remains. A capability becomes unavailable when its defining operation requires an unavailable external dependency. A governed operation becomes blocked when required authority, trust, consent, policy, freshness, or evidence cannot be verified.

### 4.2 System health and connectivity

Connectivity is a capability input, not the sole system-health signal.

The system can be healthy while offline when:

- local authoritative stores are consistent;
- required local runtimes are available;
- installed artifacts validate;
- local authorization can be evaluated;
- local queues are durable;
- backup and diagnostics remain functional;
- external-dependent capabilities are clearly marked unavailable or narrowed.

An external provider outage does not cause unrelated local components to report global failure.

### 4.3 Baseline component behavior

The following table describes the system-level offline envelope. Exact implementation details remain owned by component and profile contracts.

| Component or surface | Offline behavior | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resource Governor | Continues deterministic resource allocation, admission, throttling, suspension, and protection of local critical work. | It does not use AI and remains separate from governance authorization. |
| Orgo | Continues locally available work management and orchestration using authoritative local data and installed integrations. | Remote-only actions remain queued, unavailable, or blocked according to their contract. |
| Kristal Runtime | Continues serving installed, validated Exchange and Runtime Packs. | It does not fetch missing packs or treat cached external output as an active pack. |
| Konnaxion | Continues local capabilities backed by installed modules, local data, and available local services. | Remote data and remote-only modules are not fabricated or silently substituted. |
| SemantiK Architect | Continues planner-centered generation with already admitted local runtime/backend assets supported by the active profile. | Missing language/construction/backend capability remains unavailable; runtime mode does not invoke undeclared compilers or external services implicitly. |
| GF tooling / GF Wordbench | Operates only when the selected Architect development profile, local toolchain, sources, and dependencies are available. | It is optional and not required for every normal user-mode runtime. |
| kOA Mediatheque | Continues local media storage, identity, versioning, provenance, visibility enforcement, collections, and deterministic local processing supported by installed tools. | It does not infer categories, summarize content, select publication channels, or invoke external AI automatically. |
| UCKK publication queue | Can preserve an explicitly requested publication draft and selected source references locally. | No external delivery occurs offline; authorization must be revalidated before bridge transport. |
| Ariane Runtime | Continues Atlas-based observation, structured-goal selection, guidance, approved local automation, action verification, and local receipts. | External voice understanding is unavailable when its external path is unavailable. |
| Governance Policy Runtime | Continues local authorization and disclosure evaluation only when the active profile deploys it with the required local policy artifacts. | If required policy authority cannot be evaluated, affected governed operations remain blocked. |
| Publication Gateway | Continues local validation and preparation of publication requests where local authority is sufficient. | Delivery to an unavailable external target does not complete; queued requests require revalidation before release. |
| Audit Broker | Continues local structured event capture and protected evidence handling. | It does not require disclosure of complete private content. |
| Identity and Trust | Continues local identity and trust decisions supported by active local credentials, trust roots, and permitted cached status. | Operations requiring fresh remote status remain blocked when that status is unavailable. |
| kOA Node Agent | Continues profile-authorized local health, lifecycle, and node coordination functions. | It does not treat unreachable remote control planes as authorization to self-broaden. |
| SenTient | Remains optional, isolated, on demand, and non-authoritative. Its exact offline envelope belongs to its component and profile contracts. | Its absence or failure does not remove a native baseline capability. |
| ChatGPT | Unavailable as an external surface when its service or route is unavailable. | No local substitute is inferred. |
| Suno | Unavailable as an external surface when its service or route is unavailable. | No native media generation is implied. |
| Gamma | Unavailable as an external surface when its service or route is unavailable. | No native presentation generation is implied. |
| Ariane external voice path | Voice input is disabled or shown unavailable. | Structured local Ariane operation remains available. |

### 4.4 Local authoritative data

Each component continues to own its authoritative data offline. Connectivity loss does not merge data ownership or permit direct writes into another component’s authoritative store.

Cross-component work uses declared contracts, local events, queues, receipts, or gateways. A temporary inability to deliver an event does not authorize a direct database write as a fallback.

Durable pending work records:

- origin;
- intended recipient;
- operation;
- payload reference;
- authority context;
- consent context where applicable;
- creation time;
- expiration or revalidation rule;
- retry state;
- final result.

### 4.5 External AI boundary

The native baseline does not depend on AI.

Offline behavior therefore does not include:

- automatic local classification;
- automatic local summarization;
- automatic local translation through an unspecified model;
- automatic category selection;
- automatic channel selection;
- automatic visibility decisions;
- automatic voice-intent inference;
- automatic replacement of ChatGPT, Suno, or Gamma;
- automatic use of SenTient as a substitute for unavailable external AI.

A user can continue a workflow manually by entering selected information, choosing a category, selecting an action, or importing an externally produced result after review. Manual continuation does not make the external system native.

### 4.6 Ariane offline behavior

Ariane separates structured navigation from optional voice input.

Offline Ariane can use:

- predefined goals;
- local structured commands;
- Atlas routes;
- operator-selected actions;
- step-by-step guidance;
- locally authorized automation;
- local observation and verification;
- local safety policy;
- local receipts.

The external voice path converts speech into a candidate structured command. It does not own the Atlas, authorize actions, or execute interface operations directly. When unavailable, the voice control is disabled without disabling local Ariane navigation.

### 4.7 kOA Mediatheque and offline learning behavior

The kOA Mediatheque remains user-directed, private by default, and deterministic offline.

The local workflow can include:

```text
user selects local material or a verified transfer package
→ system validates integrity, provenance, rights, and compatibility
→ user chooses local visibility and acceptance
→ kOA Mediatheque creates local identity and version
→ original bytes and provenance are preserved
→ deterministic local derivatives are scheduled
→ user receives local confirmation
```

Already accepted UCKK courses, learning paths, instructions, manuals, and resources remain locally consultable without a live UCKK connection.

Installed deterministic tools can generate thumbnails, previews, transcodes, text extraction, checksums, and other reproducible derivatives defined by active contracts. These operations do not constitute AI content understanding.

Publication is never an automatic consequence of local ingestion or UCKK import. A remote update is a new import candidate, not permission to overwrite the local copy.

### 4.8 Installed artifact behavior

Offline operation relies on activated local artifacts such as:

- system and service releases;
- governance policy bundles;
- Kristal artifacts;
- compiled PGF;
- language runtime packs;
- Ariane Atlases and Runtime Packs;
- kOA Mediatheque processing tools;
- verified UCKK-derived course and learning-path packages accepted for local use;
- profile contracts;
- trust roots;
- schemas;
- local recovery artifacts.

A missing optional artifact removes only the capability that depends on it. A missing artifact required by the active profile blocks activation or narrows the affected capability according to the profile contract.

The system does not download an unverified replacement automatically when reconnecting.

### 4.9 Time, identity, and trust

Offline operation can make time-sensitive authority uncertain.

Examples include:

- expired credentials;
- certificate status;
- consent expiration;
- exception expiration;
- policy validity;
- release validity;
- remote revocation status;
- lease or delegation expiration.

When a decision requires current time or fresh remote status and the required confidence is unavailable, the affected operation remains blocked or restricted. Existing local read-only access can continue only when active policy explicitly permits it.

The system records clock uncertainty rather than silently extending authority.

### 4.10 Local backup, restore, and diagnostics

Offline deployments can:

- create local backups;
- verify locally available backup manifests;
- restore through the active recovery procedure;
- inspect local health and readiness;
- export support bundles under active privacy policy;
- inspect logs and receipts;
- verify installed artifacts;
- diagnose storage, queue, resource, and component state.

Remote support, remote evidence submission, and cloud backup remain optional external capabilities. Their absence does not disable local backup or diagnostics.

### 4.11 Update and release behavior

Loss of connectivity does not invalidate the currently activated compatible release set solely because a newer release may exist.

While offline:

- update discovery can be unavailable;
- remote package retrieval can be unavailable;
- current active releases continue according to their validity and profile policy;
- an offline bundle can be imported when the profile supports that mechanism;
- candidate artifacts remain inactive until verification and compatibility checks pass;
- partial update state is not accepted as authority.

Reconnection does not trigger unreviewed update installation.

### 4.12 Reconnection model

Reconnection is a controlled state transition.

The system:

1. detects the availability of each exact external dependency;
2. stabilizes connectivity before enabling dependent operations;
3. refreshes only the authority and status information allowed by policy;
4. validates queued operations against current decisions, consent, identity, trust, policy, versions, destinations, and expiration;
5. identifies conflicts between local and remote state;
6. presents or applies the declared conflict-resolution procedure;
7. resumes only eligible operations;
8. records results and permanent failures;
9. keeps unrelated local work available throughout the transition.

A queued request records historical user intent. It is not permanent authorization to execute later.

## 6. Procedures or State Transitions

### 6.1 Offline startup

The offline startup procedure is:

1. Load the active profile and its required local authority.
2. Load the active compatible release identities and installed artifacts.
3. Validate local component stores, queues, trust roots, policy bundles, and required runtime assets.
4. Start critical local services in dependency order.
5. Classify each exact external dependency as reachable, unreachable, unauthorized, incompatible, or not configured.
6. Start native components without waiting indefinitely for optional external dependencies.
7. Mark each capability according to its satisfied dependency envelope.
8. Disable external-only controls that cannot execute.
9. preserve structured local alternatives where they exist;
10. expose actionable local diagnostics without requiring remote telemetry;
11. record the startup result and any blocked profile requirement.

An optional provider does not delay the usable local system through repeated blocking retries.

### 6.2 Transition from connected to offline

When an active external dependency becomes unavailable:

1. Identify the affected integration and in-flight operations.
2. Stop creating new operations that require that dependency unless durable queueing is explicitly allowed.
3. Complete locally safe atomic work or roll it back according to its contract.
4. Mark remote delivery as unconfirmed until an authoritative receipt exists.
5. Persist eligible pending work with its authority and revalidation context.
6. Disable or narrow the affected interface control.
7. keep unrelated local components available;
8. protect local authoritative data and in-progress local writes;
9. reduce retry pressure through deterministic backoff or suspension;
10. record the transition without copying sensitive payloads into logs.

### 6.3 Steady offline operation

During steady offline operation:

1. Local health is evaluated independently from provider reachability.
2. Native services use local authoritative data and active installed artifacts.
3. External-only operations remain unavailable, narrowed, or durably queued according to contract.
4. Resource Governor protects interactive and critical local work.
5. kOA Mediatheque background derivatives can be delayed without blocking ingestion or local access.
6. SenTient remains stopped unless an allowed local profile explicitly activates it.
7. Ariane uses structured local input and local Atlas execution.
8. Backup, restore preparation, evidence capture, and diagnostics remain local.
9. Time and trust uncertainty are surfaced to affected authority checks.
10. No unavailable external capability is silently replaced by inferred behavior.

### 6.4 Local queue admission

Before an external or cross-boundary operation enters a durable queue:

1. Resolve the owning component.
2. Identify the exact intended operation and destination.
3. Verify that queueing is permitted for that operation class.
4. Record the user or system intent.
5. Record the authority, consent, decision, policy, and exception context.
6. Record the source version and payload reference without duplicating authoritative data unnecessarily.
7. Record expiration and mandatory revalidation conditions.
8. identify whether later human confirmation is required;
9. reject queueing when delayed execution would be unsafe or semantically invalid;
10. return a local receipt that distinguishes queue acceptance from final completion.

### 6.5 Reconnection

The reconnection procedure is:

1. Detect and stabilize each recovered dependency independently.
2. Avoid enabling dependent controls on a single transient success.
3. Refresh required remote identity, trust, consent, policy, destination, compatibility, and provider-status information.
4. Compare active local and remote versions.
5. Classify conflicts before mutation.
6. Revalidate every pending operation using current authority.
7. Request renewed human confirmation where the operation, elapsed time, destination, content, policy, or risk requires it.
8. Execute eligible operations in a bounded and resource-governed order.
9. Record authoritative completion receipts.
10. Retain permanent failure and rejection evidence.
11. Remove completed queue entries through the applicable retention policy.
12. Keep local native capabilities available during reconciliation.

### 6.6 Synchronization conflict handling

A synchronization conflict is handled by:

1. preserving both candidate states;
2. identifying canonical ownership for each field or object;
3. comparing versions, lineage, receipts, and applicable policy;
4. applying an automatic merge only when the contract defines a deterministic merge;
5. escalating an ambiguous or authority-sensitive conflict to human review;
6. avoiding last-writer-wins when it could overwrite authoritative work silently;
7. recording the selected result and rejected alternative;
8. regenerating affected indexes, projections, and contexts after authority is stable.

### 6.7 Offline update import

When a profile supports offline update bundles:

1. Receive the bundle through the approved import boundary.
2. Preserve the currently active release.
3. Verify bundle structure, identity, provenance, signatures, compatibility, and profile applicability.
4. inspect required system, services, governance, and knowledge channel relationships;
5. stage candidate artifacts separately from active artifacts;
6. execute applicable tests;
7. create activation evidence;
8. activate atomically according to the artifact class;
9. retain rollback or forward-repair capability;
10. reject incomplete, incompatible, unauthorized, or unverifiable bundles.

### 6.8 Recovery after local failure

Offline recovery:

1. enters the profile-defined recovery environment;
2. identifies the last verified active release and data state;
3. protects authoritative user data before repair;
4. verifies available backups and recovery artifacts;
5. restores component stores through their owning contracts;
6. preserves provenance, restrictions, and queue state;
7. validates cross-component references;
8. starts only the capabilities whose dependencies validate;
9. records degraded or blocked capabilities;
10. avoids contacting external services unless the operator explicitly selects an approved recovery path.

## 7. Failure States and Safe Degradation

| Failure state | Local behavior | Unavailable or blocked behavior | Recovery evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet route unavailable | Native local services continue. | External AI, remote synchronization, remote publication, remote updates, and remote support are unavailable or queued according to contract. | Connectivity transition record |
| Name resolution unavailable | Existing local addresses and local services continue where configured. | Operations requiring unresolved external names remain unavailable. | Resolver health record |

Safe degradation preserves the smallest safe local capability. It does not:

- widen access;
- invent authority;
- bypass Publication Gateway;
- skip consent;
- substitute Resource Governor for policy;
- write directly across component stores;
- declare queued work complete;
- treat stale data as fresh;
- activate unverified artifacts;
- infer AI output;
- disable all local operation because one external dependency failed.

## 8. Cross-Component Interactions

### 8.1 Component ownership

Each component owns its authoritative data and decides whether a requested local operation is valid inside its contract. Offline operation does not change ownership.

A component can emit an event, request, receipt, or artifact for another component. The receiving component validates and accepts it through its own contract.

### 8.2 Resource Governor and Governance Policy Runtime

Resource Governor decides whether sufficient local resources exist and how permitted workloads are prioritized.

Governance Policy Runtime decides whether governed actions are authorized where an active profile deploys it.

An operation can require both decisions:

`text
governance authorization
 -> resource admission
 -> component execution
 -> result verification
 -> evidence
`

A positive resource decision does not authorize an operation. A positive policy decision does not guarantee resource availability.

### 8.3 UCKK interchange while offline

Outbound publication and inbound acquisition degrade independently.

For `publish_to_uckk`, a request may be queued locally but is not delivered and is never reported as published. On reconnection, Publication Gateway revalidates authorization, rights, source version, destination, and expiry before UCKK-specific packaging and transport.

For `import_from_uckk`, an already complete transferred package may be validated and accepted offline when its source evidence, license, manifest, signatures, hashes, compatibility, and required resources are locally verifiable. An incomplete or unverifiable package remains quarantined. Discovery of new UCKK content and live download remain unavailable.

No reconnect operation silently synchronizes the two Mediatheques. Remote changes become candidates for explicit comparison and import.

### 8.4 Ariane and application components

Ariane uses local Atlases, component-visible state, declared actions, safety policy, and driver capabilities.

Ariane does not mutate another component’s authoritative data through hidden database access. It interacts through the supported user interface or declared component contract and verifies the observable result.

### 8.5 Identity, trust, and time

Components request identity and trust decisions through declared interfaces. They do not create their own broader fallback authority when a central or profile-required trust source is unavailable.

Where local cached status is allowed, the cache has a declared validity and scope. Expiration or uncertainty is visible to the requesting operation.

### 8.6 Backup and restore

Backup collects component-authorized snapshots or exports. Restore returns data through component-owned procedures.

Backup and restore preserve:

- data ownership;
- object identity;
- versions;
- provenance;
- visibility;
- cultural-rights restrictions;
- consent and revocation state;
- queue state;
- release identity;
- migration state.

### 8.7 External integration removal

An optional integration can be removed or disabled without breaking the native core.

Removal includes:

- disabling new requests;
- resolving or rejecting pending requests;
- preserving local source data;
- retaining required receipts;
- removing credentials according to policy;
- updating generated contexts and user-visible capability state;
- proving that unrelated local capabilities remain available.

### 8.8 Generated AI contexts

Generated AI contexts can help an agent identify the applicable offline rules for a profile or component. They remain derived projections.

When a context is missing or stale, the agent reads active canonical sources. It does not guess a fallback capability, external provider, local AI implementation, queue policy, or conflict rule.

## 9. Decision Closure and Prohibited Assumptions

The decisions listed in the metadata close the offline model used by this document.

The following assumptions are prohibited:

1. Offline means that every local network is unavailable.
2. Online means that every external provider is usable.
3. Provider reachability proves provider authorization.
4. A cached external result is current or authoritative.
5. The native baseline includes an unspecified local AI.
6. SenTient replaces unavailable external AI.
7. SenTient is required for normal user operation.
8. Voice availability defines Ariane availability.
9. Ariane requires Internet for structured local navigation.
10. kOA Mediatheque requires AI to classify, summarize, or publish content.
11. A thumbnail or transcode is AI analysis.
12. Ingestion implies publication permission.
13. A queued publication is already published.
14. A downloaded UCKK package is authoritative before validation and explicit local acceptance.
15. Reconnection permits silent overwrite or background bidirectional synchronization between the two Mediatheques.
14. A queued request remains authorized indefinitely.
15. Reconnection authorizes automatic replay.
16. The newest remote version automatically wins a conflict.
17. Last-writer-wins is safe for authoritative data.
18. Connectivity loss permits direct database writes across components.
19. Resource availability implies authorization.
20. Authorization implies resource availability.
21. Current local implementation behavior is the canonical offline contract.
22. An optional integration outage is global system failure.
23. Remote update unavailability invalidates the active local release.
24. A reconnect event authorizes automatic update installation.
25. A local backup requires cloud access.
26. Remote support unavailability removes local diagnostics.
27. A stale trust or consent record can be extended implicitly.
28. An offline profile can weaken global data-ownership or AI-boundary rules.
29. A recipe defines the universal retry, queue, network, or synchronization policy.
30. A generated context proves that omitted capabilities or restrictions do not exist.

When a requested behavior depends on an absent canonical decision, undefined conflict policy, missing profile rule, unavailable authority source, or unknown external-provider behavior, the affected behavior remains blocked until the owning registry or contract defines it.

## 11. Non-Normative Examples

### 11.1 Internet outage during normal user work

The Internet route fails while a user manages local Orgo tasks, reads installed Kristal content, organizes kOA Mediatheque media, and uses Ariane guidance. Those local capabilities continue. ChatGPT controls and Ariane voice input show unavailable. No global system-failure state is reported.

### 11.2 Offline kOA Mediatheque ingestion

A user imports a video into the kOA Mediatheque, selects local metadata and visibility, and confirms ingestion. The Mediatheque verifies the file, creates the initial version, stores provenance, and schedules a deterministic preview. It does not summarize the video, select a publication channel, or send it to an external service.

### 11.3 Ariane without voice

The external voice provider is unavailable. The user selects a predefined goal in Ariane. Ariane loads the local Atlas, presents a route, requests confirmation for a sensitive action, executes an approved local interaction, and verifies the result.

### 11.4 Queued publication and offline course import

A user approves an outbound publication request while UCKK is unavailable. The local system records a pending request, not a completed publication. After reconnection, consent has expired, so revalidation rejects delivery and records the reason.

Separately, an isolated school receives a complete signed UCKK course package on removable media. The package passes source, license, signature, hash, compatibility, and completeness checks. The kOA Mediatheque accepts a local copy that remains available offline and preserves the UCKK source as provenance.

### 11.5 Stale trust status

A local credential is present, but the requested high-impact operation requires a fresh remote revocation check. Local read-only use continues under policy. The high-impact operation remains blocked until fresh status is available.

### 11.6 Optional SenTient task

A user requests an isolated SenTient task on a profile that supports it. The workbench cannot start because its local dependencies are missing. The task fails locally without affecting Orgo, Kristal, Konnaxion, kOA Mediatheque, Ariane, the language runtime, or Resource Governor.

### 11.7 Reconnection conflict

A local object and its remote counterpart were both modified while disconnected. The synchronization contract has no deterministic field-level merge for the conflict. The system preserves both versions and requests human resolution instead of applying last-writer-wins.

### 11.8 Offline update bundle

An operator imports a signed offline bundle. Verification finds that its governance channel version is incompatible with the selected services release. The current release remains active, and the candidate bundle is rejected without partial activation.

### 11.9 Remote support outage

Remote support is unavailable during a local incident. The operator still runs local diagnostics, verifies installed artifacts, exports a privacy-filtered support bundle, and stores it for later authorized transmission.

### 11.10 Resource pressure while offline

kOA Mediatheque preview generation and a developer build create storage and CPU pressure. Resource Governor delays the preview job and lowers build resources while preserving local writes and Ariane responsiveness. It does not decide whether either operation is authorized.

## Offline Presentation Behavior

An active Space declares offline behavior for every route and widget. Locally admitted navigation and interface assets can remain available, while online-only contributions enter an explicit unavailable or degraded state. Network loss does not select a substitute module, broaden authorization, or make cached presentation data authoritative.
