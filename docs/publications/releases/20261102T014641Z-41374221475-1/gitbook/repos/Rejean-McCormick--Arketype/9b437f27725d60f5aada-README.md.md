# Arketype

**A visual archetype library for Kristal knowledge-state workspaces**  
**Declared release:** 1.6.0 · **Status:** local design library, non-normative

> **Code snapshot verification (2026-10-27):** The supplied source snapshot does not include the application logo assets or 19 historical `build/v9` receipts, and contains an extra deposition form in `modeles/dossier-suivi`. Re-running the tests on that snapshot produced **78 tests: 67 passed, 6 failed, 3 errors, 2 skipped**; `validate --check-kit` fails. This does not prove the author's complete local repository is missing those files, because the snapshot may omit generated assets. See [snapshot verification details](docs/SNAPSHOT_VERIFICATION_2026-10-27.md). Do not use the older release validation report as proof of this specific snapshot's current test result.

Arketype helps you explore, compare, and instantiate different structural forms of Kristals. It provides neutral workspace templates, documented archetypes, illustrative composition plans, a visual HTML catalogue, and local creation tools. Its diagrams explain *how a knowledge structure is organized*; they do not certify claims, establish domain standards, or authorize operational actions.

| Included | Count | What it means |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Archetypes | **19** | Distinct structural starting points |
| Neutral workspaces | **19** | Empty local templates with separate `state_ref` identities |
| Composition recipes | **23** | Design-only ways to combine forms while preserving boundaries |
| Use-case profiles | **21** | Concrete scenarios such as troubleshooting, taxonomy and employee follow-up |
| Situated diagrams | **40** | Labeled illustrations, one per archetype and use-case profile |
| Visual patterns | **10** | A shared vocabulary: tree, network, matrix, timeline, casefile and others |

## Described in the 1.6.0 release: logo and ecosystem alignment

- The release notes describe an unchanged user-supplied SVG logo (`assets/logo-k.svg`) and its Tkinter PNG derivative (`assets/logo-k-ui.png`). **Neither application asset is present in the supplied snapshot**. The separate Wiki copy does contain the SVG; do not assume the GUI assets are installed until checked locally.
- The 1.6.0 historical validation describes regenerated v9 receipts and separated casefile/deposition forms. **The supplied snapshot omits the receipts and retains an extra deposition form in `dossier-suivi`**. Confirm those packaging fixes in a complete checkout before claiming a passing validation.
- Updated the opt-in v11 Authoring Kit to **4.0.0-draft.3** (selectively pinned vendor files), design baseline to **Framework 11.0.0-draft.4**, and external read-only diK baseline to **alpha.7**.
- See [the upgrade notes](docs/15_MISE_A_JOUR_ARKETYPE_160.md) and [the validation report](VALIDATION_160.md).

## Start here

1. Extract the repository archive, then **double-click `Lancer_Arketype.pyw`** on Windows (Python 3.10+ with Tkinter). It opens a unified desktop launcher with **Home**, **Catalogue**, **Create Kristal**, and **Developer Ops**. The Catalogue is searchable in the launcher; **Open full visual catalogue** opens the illustrated offline HTML view. The Developer Ops console runs only an explicit allowlist of local library commands, tests and validation—never an arbitrary shell.
2. You can also open **`catalogue/index.html`** directly without Python or Tkinter. It provides search, structural filters, labeled diagrams and links to JSON. Read the **[GitHub Wiki source](wiki/Home.md)** for concepts, detailed archetype descriptions, examples, composition rules, and safety boundaries.
3. Use Python 3.10+ to explore or instantiate a workspace from the repository root:

```bash
python arketype.py list
python arketype.py search "taxonomy"
python arketype.py profiles
python arketype.py profile troubleshooting-systeme
python arketype.py recipes
python arketype.py validate --check-kit
```

To **preview** a new local workspace without writing anything:

```bash
python arketype.py create --type taxonomie-classification \
  --slug nature-atlas --title "Nature Atlas" --parent . --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` to create `./nature-atlas` with a new identity and an empty canon. The Windows **desktop launcher** is `Lancer_Arketype.pyw` (Python with Tkinter). The historical validation describes a Linux virtual-display GUI smoke test; the supplied snapshot is missing the logo assets and was not re-tested on native Windows. The creation page previews before writing. Developer Ops runs on a background thread to keep the window responsive.

## The catalogue and its source data

The visual catalogue is a **generated projection**, not a live reader of committed Kristal states. Update its source inventories and regenerate it when needed:

```bash
python arketype.py build-html
```

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `catalogue.json` | Catalogue index and archetype file references |
| `archetypes/*.json` | Individual archetype definitions and semantic boundaries |
| `inventaires/archetypes-visuels.json` | Visual properties of the 19 archetypes |
| `inventaires/grammaire-visuelle.json` | Ten standardized diagram patterns |
| `inventaires/diagrammes-situes.json` | Labeled, illustrative nodes and edges |
| `inventaires/profils-usage.json` | Twenty-one profiles with scope expectations and coverage checks |
| `inventaires/taxonomie-usages.json` | Independent usage / domain / integration dimensions |
| `inventaires/cas-reels-usage.json` | Noncanonical mappings to the supplied example archives |
| `assemblages/*.json` | Twenty-three noncanonical composition proposals |
| `modeles/` | Neutral Authoring Kit workspaces; not populated domain datasets |
| `catalogue/index.html` | Offline HTML interface generated from JSON |
| `catalogue/Arketype_Visual_Catalogue_v1.4.0.pdf` | Optional historical printable catalogue (not present in this snapshot; HTML is included) |
| `wiki/` | English GitHub Wiki pages, ready for a separate Wiki repository |
| `Lancer_Arketype.pyw` | Single Windows entrypoint for the desktop launcher |
| `arketype_gui.py` | Offline desktop UI: Home, Catalogue, Create Kristal, Developer Ops |
| `arketype_launcher_ops.py` | Tested allowlist for local console operations (no shell) |

The visual interfaces reference brand color **`#1E6864`** and the approved SVG/PNG paths. The provided snapshot does not include the application files at those paths; if a local checkout also lacks them, the visual assets must be restored before asserting a complete GUI package.

## Representative use cases

- **System troubleshooting:** causal diagnosis linked to observations, test results, and system-state snapshots.
- **Procedural environments:** branching protocols with roles, preconditions, exceptions, and separately recorded execution traces.
- **Nature taxonomy:** tree-based classifications with explicit criteria and sources.
- **System-state tracking:** a matrix of observed systems, indicators, and dated snapshots.
- **Employee follow-up:** a restricted casefile combining notes, actions, supporting documents, and timeline references.

The same foundation also supports UCKK-style federations, multi-use Ekole knowledge references, sparse proof maps, media universes, research memory, and testimony/deposition records.

## New in 1.4.0: from structure to use-case and scope

The **19 original structural archetypes remain intact**. Use-case profiles now specify five independent design dimensions: structural composition, usage family, domain, integration targets and authority/data boundaries. There are **21 use-case profiles**, **23 noncanonical assembly recipes**, and **40 diagrams**. The new profiles cover UCKK federation and Moodle export design, attributed traditions, contextual social organizations, mathematical proof landmarks/research, school/medical/civic casefiles, vehicle diagnosis, police/hospital operations, MediKristal knowledge orchestration, Québec education mapping, Ekole-style reuse, and testimony.

`arketype.py` now supports read-only local profile recognition and generation of a **noncanonical scope guidance** JSON. These are *suggestions*; neither scanning nor a matching filename proves content coverage, scientific validity or readiness. For multi-project archives, use `--focus` to avoid cross-project matches.

```bash
python arketype.py uses
python arketype.py profiles
python arketype.py recognize --path /path/to/kristal-or-archive.zip --focus optional/subproject
python arketype.py scope-guide --profile diagnostic-vehicule
python arketype.py create --profile dossier-scolaire --slug suivi-scolaire-test --title "School dossier" --parent . --dry-run
```

The generated `arketype.scope-guidance/1.0` is a **design exchange document**, not a `state_scope` mutation, a Skope `kristal-scope-proposal/1.0` payload or a publication command. For injection, Skope and the local owner must inspect and explicitly approve a separately mapped proposal. See [docs/12_USAGE_PROFILES_AND_SCOPES.md](docs/12_USAGE_PROFILES_AND_SCOPES.md).

## Framework v11 and diK readiness (introduced in 1.5.0; updated in 1.6.0)

Creation supports a deliberately **optional** v11-ready mode while retaining the 19 original neutral archetypes and legacy Kit 3.2.4 workspaces:

```bash
python arketype.py create --type taxonomie-classification \
  --slug taxonomy-new --title "Taxonomy new" --parent . --authoring v11 --dry-run
python arketype.py create --type taxonomie-classification \
  --slug taxonomy-new --title "Taxonomy new" --parent . --authoring v11
python arketype.py semantic-status --path ./taxonomy-new
```

`--authoring v11` runs the bundled Kit **4.0.0-draft.3**, retains an **empty** canonical state and provides `design/v11-semantic-readiness.json`. It does **not** mint KQ/KP/KA/KS, enable strict v11 automatically, create fake Wikidata QIDs, fabricate multilingual labels, or publish anything. Actual v11 activation requires valid namespaced identities, graph, crosswalk and dictionary catalog registered as logical artifacts, then an explicit `tools/kristal.py enable-v11` + `check-v11`. Read [Framework v11 and diK](docs/14_FRAMEWORK_V11_ET_DIK.md).

For **read-only diK completeness** with an explicit trusted diK source directory:

```bash
python arketype.py dik-coverage --dik-root /path/to/diK-v1.0.0-alpha.7 \
  --project /path/to/dik.project.json --locales fr,en,fr-CA
```

The source is executed **only** because it is explicitly supplied; this command does not download diK, change a dictionary or write a report file. Words in design diagrams remain descriptive; only admitted v11 **canonical graphs** require KQ/KP identities.

## Important boundaries

**Archetypes are proposed designs, not official Kristal contracts.** Arketype does not replace Kristal Framework, the Authoring Kit, domain-specific validation, or operational applications. Its templates contain no committed domain assertions, and its composition recipes are expressly marked `design_only`.

- A recorded statement is not automatically a verified fact; a causal hypothesis is not an authorized remedy.
- System observation, desired configuration, computed status, and operational decision remain distinct.
- Employee, testimony, medical, and other sensitive records require a separate application with access control, retention rules, consent/legal basis where applicable, and audit protections. Do not put real sensitive data into the public templates.
- **Building is not qualifying, synchronizing, publishing, or activating.** `check` and `build-v9` validate local technical structure, not domain truth.

## Validate and extend

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python arketype.py validate --check-kit
```

The 19 historical template workspaces and legacy creation mode are designed to use **Authoring Kit 3.2.4**. An optional **Authoring Kit 4.0.0-draft.3** is bundled for `--authoring v11` and the design reference is **Kristal Framework 11.0.0-draft.4**. diK **1.0.0-alpha.7** can be connected read-only through an explicitly selected local source checkout. No test has certified cross-repository production conformance. See [Getting Started](wiki/Getting-Started.md), [Architecture](wiki/Architecture.md), [CLI Reference](wiki/CLI-Reference.md), [Validation and Testing](wiki/Validation-and-Testing.md), and [Security and Boundaries](wiki/Security-and-Boundaries.md) for the detailed workflow.

## GitHub Wiki publishing

The `wiki/` folder is **ready-to-publish Wiki content**, but GitHub stores a repository Wiki in a **separate Git repository**. Committing this folder to the main Arketype repository does **not** publish the Wiki automatically. Follow [Publishing the Wiki](wiki/Publishing-the-Wiki.md) after enabling the Wiki on the intended GitHub repository; no remote publication is performed by this archive.
