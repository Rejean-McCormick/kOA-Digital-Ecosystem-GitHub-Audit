# **Konnaxion v14 – Custom Database Tables (Canonical List)**

*(Tables provided by Django or boilerplate (e.g. `auth_user`, `django_admin_log`, `socialaccount_*`) are omitted. Each entry lists the **Display Name → Model Class**, followed by a brief purpose and key columns (primary keys, foreign keys, enums, JSON fields; standard timestamps omitted unless notable). Structure and naming follow the v14 modular architecture as implemented.)*

**Note:** The above list is derived from the Konnaxion v14 documentation and the latest Django models and migration definitions. It is structured by module and sub-module for clarity, and is intended to replace the outdated canonical tables list with an accurate, developer-friendly reference. Each table’s purpose and key schema details have been verified against the implementation and v14 specifications for completeness and correctness.
