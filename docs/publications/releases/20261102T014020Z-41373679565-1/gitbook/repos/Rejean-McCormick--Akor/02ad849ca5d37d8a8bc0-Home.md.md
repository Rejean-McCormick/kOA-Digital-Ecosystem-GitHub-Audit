# Akor — Learning in Concert

> **Akor brings children into accord through shared missions: different roles, meaningful interactions, a common purpose.**

Akor is the proposed collaboration and integration layer connecting **Kontexte**, **kompose**, **Orgo**, **Orgo_Worlds**, and **Ekole**. Its name evokes *accord*: not just agreement between software components, but the way children listen, exchange information, negotiate, help one another, and create something together.

**Akor is not a new learning management system or a second workflow engine.** It exists so that a mission designed elsewhere can become a safe, accessible, cooperative experience in Ekole—with real interdependence between learners, not merely several children viewing the same screen.

## The human purpose

Imagine three children running a fictional village bakery. The baker understands the order, the farmer has information about supplies, and the accountant checks the quantities. None is simply a spectator or a button-clicking assistant. Each has something meaningful to discover or contribute. They must **talk, compare, explain, ask, decide, and act together**.

That is Akor's product ambition: **participation through interaction**. The technology should support the learning conversation, not replace it.

## The five-system relationship

```text
Kontexte ──────── roles, stories, situations, interaction intentions
     │
kompose ───────── deterministic review, coordination design, safe role previews
     │
Orgo_Worlds ───── versioned World / WorldRelease context
     │
Orgo ──────────── authorized operational state: Cases, Tasks, Signals, workflows
     │
Akor ──────────── reviewed adapters, role-safe projections, interaction bridge
     │
Ekole ────────── learner/teacher interfaces, curriculum and learning evidence
```

This diagram describes **target responsibilities**, not a production deployment. Akor must neither bypass Orgo authorization nor invent its own competing mission state.

## What Akor should make possible

- **A role with purpose:** every participant knows why they matter.
- **A reason to talk:** learners have different, appropriately shared information or capabilities.
- **A shared decision:** progress depends on a meaningful exchange, not only independent checkboxes.
- **A safe way to participate:** speech, text, visual supports, and teacher facilitation where suitable.
- **A graceful alternative:** solo mode, absent partners, different pacing, and recovery do not punish learners.
- **Separate evidence:** mission completion is not automatically subject mastery.

## Current reality (October 17, 2026)

Akor is **named and documented, not yet implemented as a standalone production repository**. The existing `Ekole_Pont_Missions_v4_1` prototype qualifies real Kontexte/kompose inputs and validates a synthetic Orgo preparation fixture **without writing to Orgo**. No authenticated multi-child experience has been delivered by this bridge. The bakery scenario remains a synthetic draft needing pedagogical review.

See [Project Status](Project-Status) for a strictly separated *implemented / demonstrated / proposed* inventory.

**Akor principle:** *Children do not need to do the same thing to learn together. Their contributions must matter to one another.*
