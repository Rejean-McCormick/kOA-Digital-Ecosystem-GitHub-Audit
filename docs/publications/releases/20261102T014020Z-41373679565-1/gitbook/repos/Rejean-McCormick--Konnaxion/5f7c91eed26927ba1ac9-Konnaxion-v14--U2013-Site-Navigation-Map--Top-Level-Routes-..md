# Navigation Map

The list below presents **every top-level page (route)** that a user can reach from the main sidebar, module hubs, or intent cards, grouped by module and sub-module.  
Nested **tabs, drawers or modals** are noted → they do **not** create extra routes but keep related tasks together.  
All names preserve the K-branding where still relevant and avoid duplicating boilerplate authentication or error screens.

> **Revision note:** The **ethiKos** and **Insights / Reports** sections below were updated to reflect the currently implemented frontend routes. Other module sections are carried forward from the previous navigation map and should be audited module-by-module in a later doc pass.
