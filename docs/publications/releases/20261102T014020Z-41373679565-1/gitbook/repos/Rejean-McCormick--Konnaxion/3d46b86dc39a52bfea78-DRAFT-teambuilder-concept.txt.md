There is solid theory you can lean on, and it maps nicely to your “elite vs learning” modes.

I’ll pull out the most useful bits and connect them to your Team Builder idea.

1. Core models of effective teams

Hackman’s team effectiveness conditions
Hackman defines an effective team by three outcomes: good performance, positive group processes, and learning/growth for members.
Wikipedia
+1

He also identifies key conditions:

Real team (clear boundaries, stable membership, interdependence)

Compelling direction (clear, energizing purpose)

Enabling structure (right size, right mix of skills, sensible norms)

Supportive context (information, rewards, resources)

Expert coaching

For your builder:

“Elite urgent team” → heavily weight compelling direction + enabling structure + right people.

“Learning team” → still need these conditions, but you allow weaker skills as long as coaching and context are strong.

Google’s Project Aristotle (psychological safety)
Google’s big finding: the most important predictor of team effectiveness was psychological safety (people feel safe to take interpersonal risks). Other critical factors: dependability, structure & clarity, meaning, and impact.

For your builder:

Even with elites, if stakes are high (pandemic vaccine), psychological safety around speaking up is non-negotiable (you need people to call out problems fast).

For learning teams, psychological safety is the main lever that lets juniors and “difficult” members improve instead of being shut down.

GRPI model (Goals–Roles–Processes–Interpersonal)
GRPI says team issues usually come from unclear:

Goals

Roles & responsibilities

Processes & procedures

Interpersonal relationships

For your builder:

“Urgent elite team” mode → prioritize people who can handle ambiguity but still create clarity in Goals/Roles/Processes quickly.

“Learning team” mode → allow more process experimentation, but still ensure minimum clarity on goals and roles.

Belbin team roles (complementary behaviours)
Belbin focuses on complementary behavioural roles (Plant, Shaper, Implementer, Teamworker, etc.) and argues that you need a mix, not just raw IQ.

Belbin

For your builder:

You can think of your “complementary skills” not just as tech skills but also as Belbin-style roles: idea generators, finishers, coordinators, team glue, etc.

Elite team ≠ everyone the same; it’s a carefully chosen mix of high performers in different roles.

2. How context changes the criteria (elite vs learning vs risky teams)

You basically want modes that tune how the theory is applied:

Elite / urgent problem mode (e.g., vaccine team)

Priorities:

Maximise proven competence and reliability.

Minimise coordination overhead and interpersonal risk.

Criteria emphasis:

Skill depth, past performance, speed under pressure.

Strong history of execution together (positive past collaboration).

Very clear goals and roles from day one (GRPI).

Still need high psychological safety for speaking up about bad news, but you’re less tolerant of chronically disruptive behaviour.

In your builder:

Inclusion: high ability, strong track record, high dependability, good fit to task domain.

Exclusion: unresolved major conflicts, low reliability, people whose learning needs would slow the team too much.

Learning / developmental mode

Priorities:

Growth of people and capabilities.

Medium performance expectations, high learning expectations.

Criteria emphasis:

Mix of seniors and juniors.

People who want to grow into certain skills.

High psychological safety, strong coaching, time to reflect.
leadingchangenetwork.org
+1

In your builder:

Inclusion: juniors with potential, seniors willing to mentor, people underused in elite teams.

Exclusion: only the worst conflict pairs; you tolerate more imperfections because learning is the goal.

Average-only / stability mode

Priorities:

Test whether a “normal” group, with no stars and no extreme problems, can perform reliably.

Criteria emphasis:

Filter out extremes (very high and very low performers, very difficult people).

Strong clarity of goals, roles, processes to compensate for lack of stars (GRPI again).
AIHR
+1

In your builder:

Inclusion: mid-range performance, cooperative attitude, decent reliability.

Exclusion: stars and very difficult members for this mode.

High-risk / rehabilitation mode (strong leader + difficult members)

Priorities:

Use a very strong leader and structure to try to turn difficult players into productive ones.

Criteria emphasis:

One or two very strong, stable people (leader, co-leader).

Limit how many difficult players per team.

Psychological safety is tricky: you want openness but not chaos, so the leader’s ability to set norms is key.
The Commons

In your builder:

Inclusion: difficult members who have some positive signal or potential; strong leader with conflict-handling history.

Exclusion: certain toxic combinations (hard-coded conflict pairs) and putting the same difficult person constantly into “rehab” teams.

3. Translating theory into your inclusion / exclusion rules

Using these models, your Team Builder can treat criteria like this:

Inclusion signals:

Skill fit and diversity (Belbin + hard skills).

Past positive collaboration, trust, cohesion (Hackman, GRPI).
Wikipedia
+1

Availability and load.

Willingness to mentor / to learn (for learning mode).

Exclusion signals:

Persistent severe conflict pairs (interpersonal relationships in GRPI).
Training
+1

Overload or burnout risk.

Too many “difficult” members without counterbalancing stabilizers.

And then tune weights per mode:

Elite: skill & reliability > learning opportunity.

Learning: learning opportunity & diversity > raw speed.

Rehab/risky: opportunity for turnaround + strong leader > comfort.

4. Practical implication for your product

From this theory, concrete ideas for Konnaxion’s Team Builder:

Ask the user to choose a context:

“Urgent / critical delivery”

“Balanced performance & learning”

“Learning-heavy / safe to experiment”

“Deliberate high-risk / rehab team”

For each mode, adjust:

How much you weight: proven performance, complementarity, psychological safety history, senior-junior mix.

How strict exclusion is on “difficult” members.

Whether you allow or even encourage including a “difficult” member.

Always keep core conditions:

Real team (clear membership).

Compelling purpose.

Sound structure (good mix, reasonable size).

If you want, next step could be to define 3–4 explicit “modes” for your API, each with a small vector of weights derived from this theory (skills, past collaboration, safety, learning, fairness), so it is machine-friendly but still explainable to users.

Réflexion terminée
Vous avez dit :
how to apply this theory in my system? should we integrate it all or focus on some aspects the platform can manage well?
ChatGPT a dit :
Thought for 37s

Apply only the parts of the theory that your platform can observe and influence reliably, and express them as clear, configurable rules.

I would structure it like this.

1. Decide what the system owns vs what humans own

System should own:

Translating a context (elite vs learning vs rehab vs average) into:

inclusion signals

exclusion guardrails

a scoring function over candidate teams.

Enforcing basic constraints:

skills coverage

availability

“do not pair” conflicts.

Humans (project owner) should own:

Choosing the context/mode (“urgent elite”, “balanced”, “learning-heavy”, “rehab/high-risk”, “average-only”).

Making the final decision among 2–3 suggested teams.

Overriding specific inclusions/exclusions when necessary.

Do not try to have the algorithm “magically” decide the context; that’s where theory becomes hand-wavy.

2. Start with the criteria your platform can manage well

Pick a small set of signals that you either have now or can reasonably add:

Core inclusion signals

Skills / role fit: tags per user + required skills per project.

Experience level: simple tier (junior / mid / senior).

Past performance / reliability: project outcome rating, completion, responsiveness.

Past positive collaboration: “I liked working with X on project Y.”

Availability / workload: how many active projects, capacity.

Core exclusion / guardrail signals

Hard “do not pair” conflicts between specific users.

Overload: user at or above capacity.

Too many “difficult” members with no stabilizer (strong leader).

These map well to:

Hackman → enabling structure, supportive context (skills, availability, clear composition).

GRPI → people who can create clarity around goals/roles/processes.

Aristotle → basic proxy for psychological safety via past positive/negative collaboration.

Belbin → use skills + behaviour tags later if you want.

Everything else (deep psychological safety metrics, nuanced personality modeling, subtle diversity dimensions) can wait.

3. Represent theory as “modes” + weights, not complex rules

Define a small, explicit “team mode” object the frontend sends to the backend, e.g.:

ELITE_CRITICAL

BALANCED

LEARNING

AVERAGE_ONLY

REHAB_HIGH_RISK

For each mode, define weights on your signals:

Example (conceptual):

ELITE_CRITICAL

+++ skill_fit

+++ performance

++ past_collaboration

availability

– learning_opportunity (less tolerance for multiple juniors)

– difficult_member_penalty (strong)

hard constraints: no severe conflict pairs, strict capacity limit.

LEARNING

++ learning_opportunity (juniors + mentors)

++ diversity_of_experience

++ past_collaboration (psych safety proxy)

performance

– difficult_member_penalty (softer, but with caps)

constraints: at least one senior for each critical skill.

AVERAGE_ONLY

++ mid_range_performance (filter extremes)

++ reliability

past_collaboration

constraints: exclude top X% “stars” and bottom Y% “chronically problematic” for this mode.

REHAB_HIGH_RISK

strong_leader (hard requirement)

++ difficult_members (within a capped count)

learning_opportunity

– strong_conflict_pairs (still excluded)

constraints: 1 strong leader, ≤ N difficult members, non-critical project type.

Internally, every candidate team gets a score:

team_score = Σ(weight_i * metric_i(team)) – Σ(penalty_j * risk_j(team))

The “theory” is encoded in those weight_i and penalty_j per mode.

4. Implement in layers, not all at once
Phase 1 – Core engine (practical and shippable)

Implement:

Skills / role fit and coverage.

Experience level (junior/mid/senior).

Availability / workload.

Simple past performance score (overall rating).

Hard conflict pairs.

Support modes:

ELITE_CRITICAL

BALANCED

LEARNING

This already gives you:

Elite urgent teams where performance and reliability dominate.

Learning teams that intentionally include juniors and maybe slightly weaker performers.

Phase 2 – Collaboration + fairness

Add:

Past positive/negative collaboration between pairs.

“Difficult” flags or risk score (based on repeated bad feedback, not a single event).

Fairness tracking:

how often a person gets included vs excluded.

decay of old conflicts / bad events over time.

Use this to:

Better approximate psychological safety (pair history).

Avoid always excluding the same “difficult” people:

treat “difficult” as a penalty, not a permanent ban.

soften penalty if someone has been excluded too often and risk is low.

Add modes:

AVERAGE_ONLY

REHAB_HIGH_RISK

Phase 3 – Advanced (only if you have real value from it)

Possibilities:

Belbin-like behaviour tags (idea generator, finisher, coordinator, etc.).

Diversity metrics that are safe and lawful for your context.

Team-level outcome learning:

use historical project results to adjust weights over time.

Only do this if you have enough data and clear product value; otherwise you risk complexity without payoff.

5. Keep the UX simple and explainable

For each suggestion, show:

The selected mode (context).

2–3 short reasons, like:

“Covers all required skills with 2 seniors.”

“Includes 1 junior and 1 mentor to support learning.”

“Avoids known conflict between A and B.”

“Includes C (sometimes difficult) with strong leader D for support.”

Do not surface all the theory; just make the system choices understandable.

Summary

Do not try to integrate all of team theory directly; encode it as a small set of modes (elite, balanced, learning, average-only, rehab) with different weights on a few signals your platform can measure well.

Start with skills, experience, availability, performance, and explicit conflicts.

Then layer in collaboration history and fairness for “difficult” members.

Use the theory mainly to justify how you choose weights and guardrails, not as a giant “all-in-one” model
