# 10 — First-Pass Integration Matrix

**File:** `10_FIRST_PASS_INTEGRATION_MATRIX.md`  
**Pack:** ethiKos Kintsugi Update Documentation Pack  
**Canonical path:** `docs/Technical-Reference/Kintsugi_Kompendio/ethiKos_Kintsugi_Update/`  
**Version:** `2026-04-25-kintsugi-doc-pack-v1`  
**Status:** Canonical first-pass scope matrix  
**Module:** `ethiKos`  
**Platform:** `Konnaxion`

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **first-pass integration matrix** for the ethiKos Kintsugi Upgrade.

Its purpose is to prevent drift when translating external civic-tech inspiration into native ethiKos features.

This matrix answers:

- which external sources are in scope now;
- which sources are explicitly deferred;
- which patterns are retained;
- which patterns are rejected or postponed;
- where each pattern maps into the existing `/ethikos/*` route surface;
- which current or proposed ethiKos objects each pattern affects;
- whether each pattern should be implemented as native mimic, future annex, or no-go;
- what must not be imported, renamed, or merged.

This document is not an implementation backlog. It is a scope and alignment contract.

---

## 2. Scope

This document covers first-pass Kintsugi inspiration from:

```yaml
FIRST_PASS_OSS_SOURCES:

# 7.1 Consider.it

## 7.1.1 Status

```yaml
SOURCE: "Consider.it"
FIRST_PASS_STATUS: "in_scope"
STRATEGY: "native_mimic"
PRIORITY: "P2"
PRIMARY_ROUTE_SCOPE: "/ethikos/deliberate/*"
PRIMARY_OWNER: "Korum"
```

## 7.1.2 Retained pattern

Consider.it is retained as inspiration for:

* compact pro/con reasoning;
* surfacing reasons rather than chronological noise;
* making participant positions more legible;
* reason clusters;
* structured comparison between support and opposition.

## 7.1.3 ethiKos mapping

| Consider.it concept | ethiKos Kintsugi mapping                           |     |          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --- | -------- |
| Position on issue   | `EthikosStance`                                    |     |          |
| Reason for/against  | `EthikosArgument` with `side`                      |     |          |
| Pro/con structure   | `EthikosArgument.side = pro                        | con | neutral` |
| Reason grouping     | Future `ArgumentGraph` view or derived clustering  |     |          |
| Participant opinion | Topic-level stance + argument contribution pattern |     |          |

## 7.1.4 Route targets

```yaml
ROUTE_TARGETS:
  PRIMARY:
    - "/ethikos/deliberate/[topic]"
  SECONDARY:
    - "/ethikos/deliberate/elite"
    - "/ethikos/pulse/health"
    - "/ethikos/insights"
```

## 7.1.5 Model impact

Current models sufficient for first expression:

```yaml
CURRENT_MODELS_USED:
  - "EthikosTopic"
  - "EthikosStance"
  - "EthikosArgument"
```

Possible future support models:

```yaml
POSSIBLE_MODELS:
  - "ArgumentCluster"
  - "ArgumentSummary"
```

These possible models are not first-pass mandatory.

## 7.1.6 First-pass allowed work

Consider.it MAY inspire:

* clearer pro/con presentation;
* topic stance summary;
* reason cards;
* argument-side filtering;
* deliberation summary panels.

## 7.1.7 First-pass forbidden work

Consider.it MUST NOT cause:

* a new `considerit` app;
* external code import;
* replacement of `EthikosArgument`;
* replacement of `/ethikos/deliberate/*`;
* direct writes from external tools.

## 7.1.8 Kintsugi classification

```yaml
CLASSIFICATION:
  MIMIC: true
  ANNEX: false
  IMPORT_CODE: false
  CREATE_APP: false
```

# 7.2 Kialo-style argument mapping

## 7.2.1 Status

```yaml
SOURCE: "Kialo-style argument mapping"
FIRST_PASS_STATUS: "in_scope"
STRATEGY: "native_mimic"
PRIORITY: "P0"
PRIMARY_ROUTE_SCOPE: "/ethikos/deliberate/*"
PRIMARY_OWNER: "Korum"
```

## 7.2.2 Retained pattern

Kialo-style mapping is the canonical first-pass reference for structured deliberation.

It contributes:

* thesis-centered discussion;
* single-thesis and multi-thesis topology;
* claims as atomic argument nodes;
* pro/con relation to parent;
* argument tree navigation;
* minimap concept;
* sources attached to claims;
* impact voting on claims;
* guided voting;
* perspectives;
* suggested claims;
* participant roles;
* anonymity mode;
* author visibility;
* vote visibility;
* templates;
* small group mode;
* discussion export.

Only a subset is first pass.

## 7.2.3 Canonical ethiKos mapping

```yaml
KIALO_CANONICAL_MAPPING:
  KIALO_DISCUSSION: "EthikosTopic"
  KIALO_THESIS: "Topic thesis/prompt field; current fallback is EthikosTopic.title + description"
  KIALO_CLAIM: "EthikosArgument"
  KIALO_PRO_CON_EDGE: "EthikosArgument.parent + EthikosArgument.side"
  KIALO_SOURCE: "ArgumentSource"
  KIALO_IMPACT_VOTE: "ArgumentImpactVote"
  KIALO_SUGGESTED_CLAIM: "ArgumentSuggestion"
  KIALO_PERSPECTIVE: "DiscussionPerspective / Smart Vote lens depending context"
  KIALO_PARTICIPANT_ROLE: "DiscussionParticipantRole"
```

## 7.2.4 Critical separation

Kialo introduces claim-level impact voting. This must remain separate from ethiKos topic-level stance and Smart Vote readings.

```yaml
VOTE_TYPE_SEPARATION:
  ETHIKOS_STANCE:
    RANGE: "-3..+3"
    LEVEL: "topic-level"
    MODEL: "EthikosStance"

  KIALO_IMPACT_VOTE:
    RANGE: "0..4"
    LEVEL: "claim-level"
    PROPOSED_MODEL: "ArgumentImpactVote"

  SMART_VOTE_READING:
    RANGE: "lens-dependent"
    LEVEL: "derived aggregation"
    PROPOSED_MODEL: "ReadingResult"
```

Mandatory rules:

```yaml
CLAIM_IMPACT_VOTE_IS_TOPIC_STANCE: false
CLAIM_IMPACT_VOTE_IS_SMART_VOTE_BALLOT: false
ETHIKOS_STANCE_IS_READING: false
SMART_VOTE_READING_IS_SOURCE_FACT: false
```

## 7.2.5 Route targets

    - "/ethikos/deliberate/guidelines"
    - "/ethikos/admin/moderation"
    - "/ethikos/admin/roles"
    - "/ethikos/insights"
```

## 7.2.6 First-pass feature subset

```yaml
KIALO_FIRST_PASS_FEATURES:
  - "Argument tree using current EthikosArgument parent + side"
  - "Claim/source links"
  - "Role-aware suggested claims"
  - "Impact vote separated from topic stance"
  - "Author visibility settings"
  - "Voting visibility settings"
  - "Basic topic info/background panel"
```

## 7.2.7 Deferred Kialo features

```yaml
KIALO_DEFERRED_FEATURES:
  - "Small group mode"
  - "Sunburst minimap"
  - "Clone-from-template"
  - "Export discussion"
  - "Custom perspectives"
  - "Claim extraction into new discussion"
  - "Move/link claim across discussions"
```

## 7.2.8 Model impact

Existing models:

```yaml
CURRENT_MODELS_USED:

DEFERRED_MODEL_CANDIDATES:
  - "ArgumentBookmark"
  - "ArgumentLink"
  - "DiscussionPerspective"
  - "DiscussionTemplate"

    - "single_thesis"
    - "multi_thesis"

  KIALO_MINIMAP_MODES:
    - "tree"
    - "sunburst"
```

## 7.2.10 First-pass forbidden work

Kialo-style mapping MUST NOT cause:

* renaming `EthikosArgument` to `Claim`;
* creating `konnaxion.kialo`;
* creating `/kialo` routes;
* importing Kialo code;
* treating claim impact votes as topic stances;
* treating claim impact votes as Smart Vote ballots;

# 7.3 Loomio

## 7.3.1 Status

```yaml
SOURCE: "Loomio"
FIRST_PASS_STATUS: "in_scope"
STRATEGY: "native_mimic"
PRIORITY: "P1"
PRIMARY_ROUTE_SCOPE: "/ethikos/decide/*"
PRIMARY_OWNER: "Smart Vote + ethiKos decision layer"
```

## 7.3.2 Retained pattern

Loomio is retained as inspiration for:

* proposal lifecycle;
* time-boxed decisions;
* consent/objection/approval flows;
* explicit decision closure;
* outcome publication;
* clear transition from discussion to decision.

## 7.3.3 ethiKos mapping

| Loomio concept                  | ethiKos Kintsugi mapping                     |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

| Proposal                        | `DecisionRecord`                             |
| Poll/decision                   | `DecisionProtocol` + `DecisionRecord`        |
| Stance/vote in decision context | `BallotEvent` or Smart Vote-compatible event |
| Outcome                         | `DecisionRecord.outcome` + `ReadingResult`   |
| Closing date                    | `DecisionRecord.opens_at` / `closes_at`      |
| Decision method                 | `DecisionProtocol`                           |

## 7.3.4 Route targets

```yaml
ROUTE_TARGETS:
  PRIMARY:

  - "LensDeclaration"
  - "ReadingResult"
```

Possible support objects:

```yaml
SUPPORT_OBJECTS:
  - "BallotEvent"
  - "BaselineResult"
```

## 7.3.6 First-pass allowed work

Loomio MAY inspire:

* decision lifecycle states;
* decision protocol names;
* opening and closing windows;
* outcome publishing;
* objection/consent logic;
* result explanation.

## 7.3.7 First-pass forbidden work

Loomio MUST NOT cause:

* importing Loomio code;
* changing the authentication model;
* creating a separate decision app;

# 7.4 Citizen OS

## 7.4.1 Status

```yaml
SOURCE: "Citizen OS"
FIRST_PASS_STATUS: "in_scope"
STRATEGY: "native_mimic"
PRIORITY: "P1"
PRIMARY_ROUTE_SCOPE: "Drafting capability + /ethikos/decide/*"
PRIMARY_OWNER: "ethiKos bounded drafting capability"
```

## 7.4.2 Retained pattern

Citizen OS is retained as inspiration for:

* collaborative drafting;
* versioned text;
* amendments;
* decision-ready documents;
* structured transition from deliberation to written proposal;
* separation between discussion and text editing.

## 7.4.3 Architectural caution

Citizen OS architecture may rely on external collaborative editing infrastructure such as Etherpad-like flows. The first pass MUST NOT annex such infrastructure.

First pass should mimic the product pattern:

* draft;
* version;
* amendment;
* rationale;
* decision-ready text.

It must not integrate external pad infrastructure.

## 7.4.4 ethiKos mapping

| Citizen OS concept     | ethiKos Kintsugi mapping                                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Topic                  | `EthikosTopic`                                           |
| Collaborative document | `Draft`                                                  |

    - "/ethikos/impact/outcomes"
    - "/ethikos/admin/audit"
```

If a future `/ethikos/draft/*` route is proposed, it must be documented in `06_ROUTE_BY_ROUTE_ETHIKOS_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` and approved by ADR before implementation.

## 7.4.6 Model impact

First-pass proposed models:

```yaml
FIRST_PASS_MODEL_CANDIDATES:
  - "Draft"
  - "DraftVersion"
  - "Amendment"
  - "RationalePacket"
```

## 7.4.7 First-pass allowed work

Citizen OS MAY inspire:

* creating a draft from a topic;
* creating versions of a draft;
* attaching rationale to draft text;
* linking amendments to arguments;
* promoting a draft into a decision record.

## 7.4.8 First-pass forbidden work

Citizen OS MUST NOT cause:

* Etherpad annex in first pass;
* external collaborative editing service dependency;
* creating a separate Citizen OS route family;
* importing Citizen OS code;
* mixing draft versions directly into `EthikosArgument`;
* treating draft text as the same object as the debate topic.

## 12. Explicit no-go matrix

| Source         | No-go item                            | Reason                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Consider.it    | Import codebase                       | First pass is native mimic only            |
| Kialo          | Create `konnaxion.kialo`              | Kialo-style belongs inside Korum           |
| Kialo          | Rename `EthikosArgument` to `Claim`   | Existing model must remain stable          |
| Kialo          | Treat claim impact votes as stances   | Different semantic level                   |
| Loomio         | Replace auth/session model            | Out of scope                               |
| Loomio         | Replace Smart Vote                    | Smart Vote owns readings                   |
| Citizen OS     | Add Etherpad annex now                | Annex not allowed first pass               |
| Citizen OS     | Store draft versions as arguments     | Drafting is separate bounded capability    |
| Decidim        | Rebuild Decidim component framework   | Too large and incompatible with first pass |
| Decidim        | Switch backend style to Rails/GraphQL | Current backend is Django/DRF              |
| CONSUL         | Add full census infrastructure now    | Too broad for first pass                   |
| CONSUL         | Replace EkoH cohort context           | EkoH owns cohort/expertise context         |
| DemocracyOS    | Import Node/Mongo architecture        | Current stack remains Django/PostgreSQL    |
| DemocracyOS    | Create separate DemocracyOS routes    | Native mimic inside `/ethikos/*`           |
| Polis          | Add clustering models now             | Deferred                                   |

## 13. Integration readiness scale

Use this readiness scale in later docs and backlog planning.

```yaml
INTEGRATION_READINESS:
  R0_REJECTED:
    meaning: "Not allowed or explicitly out of scope."

  R1_REFERENCE_ONLY:
    meaning: "Useful for public credit or future research, but not first pass."

  R2_CONCEPT_MIMIC:
    meaning: "Use as product inspiration only."

  R3_CONTRACT_MIMIC:
    meaning: "Define objects, payloads, routes, and rules around this pattern."

  R4_IMPLEMENTATION_CANDIDATE:
    meaning: "Ready for later backlog after docs and code inspection."

  R5_ANNEX_CANDIDATE:
    meaning: "Possible future sidecar, requires isolation, adapter, license clearance, and ADR."
```

First-pass source readiness:

| Source                       | Readiness         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Kialo-style argument mapping | R3                |
| Loomio                       | R3                |
| Citizen OS                   | R3                |
| Decidim                      | R3                |
| CONSUL Democracy             | R2/R3             |
| DemocracyOS                  | R2/R3             |
| Consider.it                  | R2                |
| Polis                        | R1                |
| LiquidFeedback               | R1                |
| All Our Ideas                | R1                |
| Your Priorities              | R1                |
| OpenSlides                   | R1/R5 future only |

## 14. Anti-drift rules

The following rules are binding.

```yaml
ANTI_DRIFT_RULES:
  - "First-pass sources are fixed by this document."
  - "Deferred sources MUST NOT produce first-pass tasks."
  - "All first-pass source patterns are native mimic only."
  - "No external source may write directly to Korum or Konsultations core tables."
  - "No first-pass source may create a new top-level frontend app."
  - "No first-pass source may create a new backend app unless an ADR explicitly allows it later."
  - "Kialo-style features extend Korum under /ethikos/deliberate/*."
  - "Loomio-style features inform /ethikos/decide/*."
  - "Citizen OS-style features inform bounded drafting capability."
  - "Decidim-style features inform process, admin, and accountability."
  - "CONSUL-style features inform eligibility, thresholds, and governance."
  - "DemocracyOS-style features inform proposal-centric discussion."
  - "Smart Vote publishes readings only."
  - "EkoH provides expertise/ethics/cohort context only."
  - "Impact truth belongs to Konsultations/accountability, not KeenKonnect."
  - "Do not expand /api/home/*."
```
