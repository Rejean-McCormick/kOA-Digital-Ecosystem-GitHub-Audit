# Normative requirements

- **IK-ARCH-001 MUST NOT** force Konnaxion↔Orgo through Kristal unless a Profile explicitly gates on Kristal.
- **IK-ARCH-002 MUST** use DaaT (`daat`) as the baseline IK↔Kristal anti-corruption/admission boundary.
- **IK-ARCH-003 MUST** preserve participant-owned authoritative state.
- **IK-ARCH-004 MUST NOT** use IK as an operational database, artifact store or distributed transaction coordinator.
- **IK-ARCH-005 MUST NOT** require direct cross-system database writes or a distributed commit spanning participant-owned databases.
- **IK-ARCH-006 MUST** commit a publisher-owned fact before emitting an Event that claims that fact is committed.
- **IK-ARCH-007 MUST NOT** make DaaT the authority for source acquisition, artifact storage, general corpus normalization, or Kristall semantic identity.
- **IK-KRISTAL-001 MUST** preserve `kristal_state/6.0` as the active portable build/artifact contract unless a new Profile version explicitly changes that contract.
- **IK-KRISTAL-002 MUST** treat Kristal v7/Kristall semantics as additive above v6 and MUST NOT silently reinterpret existing v6 Profiles as v7 meta-artifact Profiles.
- **IK-KRISTAL-003 MUST NOT** mint or reinterpret KQ/KP/KA/KS identity inside DaaT.
- **IK-ENV-001 MUST** resolve durable Command/Query to a concrete receiver.
- **IK-ART-001 MUST NOT** interpret ArtifactRef as ownership/authority/validation transfer.
- **IK-ART-002 MUST** preserve source ownership of ExportManifest snapshots/revisions.
- **IK-ART-003 MUST NOT** embed credentials in ArtifactRef locators.
- **IK-ART-004 MUST NOT** treat a derived query/deployment materialization as authoritative operational state solely because it is locally stored or activatable.
- **IK-REL-001 MUST** preserve idempotency identity across retry/redrive.
- **IK-REL-002 MUST** reject divergent replays under the same idempotency key.
- **IK-REL-004 MUST** use deterministic cross-language semantic fingerprints.
- **IK-REL-005 MUST NOT** assume global ordering.
- **IK-VERS-001 MUST** keep published Profile/schema versions immutable.
- **IK-VERS-002 MUST** reject known incompatibility explicitly.
- **IK-UCKK-001 MUST** treat UCKK publication as a projection; UCKK publication MUST NOT transfer canonical Kristal ownership.
- **IK-UCKK-002 MUST** carry Kristal publication bundles by immutable ArtifactRef with SHA-256 integrity; IK MUST NOT become the publication artifact store.
- **IK-UCKK-003 MUST** preserve supersession/revocation provenance rather than rewriting canonical Kristal history.
- **IK-UCKK-004 MUST** route the reference Kristal publication flow through DaaT as the Kristal IK boundary participant.
