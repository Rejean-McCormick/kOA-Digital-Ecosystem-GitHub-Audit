# v4.3.2 — Refreshed scenarios + magnetic interface integration

## Purpose

Integrate the complete scenario rewrite supplied in **v4.3.1** into the magnetic Koali Scenario Mosaic without regressing the interaction model introduced in v4.3.

## Source-of-truth rule

For scenario content, v4.3.1 is authoritative. The following files are copied exactly from that corpus:

- `src/content/scenarios/en/SCN-001.md` … `SCN-120.md`;
- `src/content/scenarios/fr/SCN-001.md` … `SCN-120.md`;
- `src/data/scenarios.json`;
- `src/i18n/fr-tags.json`.

This means titles, preview summaries, domains, transfer domains, loops, scales, settings, properties, and other shared scenario metadata now describe the refreshed situations rather than the superseded stories.

## Magnetic interface retained

The integration intentionally keeps the v4.3 magnetic presentation layer:

- `MosaicTerritoryLabels.astro`;
- `territory-repulsion.ts`;
- GSAP 3.13.0 + SplitText;
- 8 normalized `territoryLabels` anchors in `mosaic-layout.json`;
- screen-reader-only semantic category legend;
- one active hexagon at a time;
- static fallback for coarse pointer and reduced motion;
- dependency-free magnetic behavior in the offline preview.

The 20 × 6 assignments are unchanged, so every refreshed `SCN-*` identity remains in its established map cell and category territory.

## Long-title adaptation

The new editorial hooks are intentionally more specific and often longer. The
preview measures the rendered title instead of estimating its size from a
character-count category.

`preview-layout.ts` starts at the normal title size, reduces the font only when
the text would require a third line, and stops at a readable minimum. An
extreme remaining overflow is clamped to two lines. The fit is recalculated on
content changes, width changes, browser zoom, and font loading.

The shared component loads this controller on both the interactive Mosaic and
public scenario pages. The offline builder copies the same controller as plain
JavaScript, so the zero-install preview has identical title and action-palette
behavior.

## Public scenario pages

Scenario routes continue to use the selected-Mosaic-state model. The public page does not render the internal Markdown body. It reuses the shared preview and displays only the five public supplemental information cells.

Internal tokens such as `PAT-*`, `SIG-*`, `POS-*`, component scores, derivation states, and runtime-evidence states remain in repository source for governance but are not emitted into the public scenario-page body.

## Compatibility

Preserved:

- `SCN-001` … `SCN-120` URLs;
- EN/FR identity parity;
- 8 categories;
- 24 pattern families;
- Mosaic geometry;
- Netlify production build contract;
- scenario PNG naming convention and SVG fallback.

## Image note

The supplied v4.3.1 archive contains the same 31 PNG assets as the previous magnetic repository. They are therefore preserved as supplied; 89 scenarios continue to use SVG fallback. Any future image editorial refresh can replace `scenario_###.png` without changing scenario content or Mosaic code.

## Validation

`npm run validate` checks both contracts simultaneously:

1. refreshed bilingual scenario content / metadata;
2. magnetic territory-label implementation and geometry.

The offline preview is regenerated from the refreshed source before validation.
