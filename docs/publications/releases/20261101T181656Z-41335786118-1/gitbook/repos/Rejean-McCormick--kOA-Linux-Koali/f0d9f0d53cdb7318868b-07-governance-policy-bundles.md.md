# Governance Policy Bundles

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the lifecycle of governance policy bundles used by deployments that instantiate Governance Policy Runtime.

A governance policy bundle is a versioned, verifiable artifact in the `governance` release channel. It packages deterministic policy modules and the metadata required to validate, stage, activate, audit, roll back, recover, deprecate, and reproduce their behavior.

The bundle carries policy implementation. It does not create its own authority. Owner decisions, profile membership, trust roots, artifact classes, release compatibility, component ownership, and exception authority remain with their canonical owners.

The active bundle format is owned by `contracts/artifact-contracts/policy-bundle.schema.json`.

## 2. Scope

This document applies to:

- deterministic governance policy source and compiled modules;
- policy-bundle manifests;
- build and compilation provenance;
- integrity and signing;
- profile and policy-runtime compatibility;
- governance release-channel publication;
- independent governance-channel updates;
- Release Set updates;
- staging and quarantine;
- target validation;
- atomic activation;
- rollback, restore, forward repair, and recovery;
- offline export and import;
- deprecation, revocation, expiry, supersession, retention, and deletion;
- activation, failure, recovery, and audit receipts;
- evidence supporting bundle, activation, and conformance claims.

It applies only to profiles that require or allow Governance Policy Runtime. It does not make the runtime a universal baseline component.

This document does not define policy semantics, owner decisions, trust-root management, source-component data, privileged execution implementation, Resource Governor policy, or publication authority.

## 4. Model and Responsibilities

### 4.1 Bundle identity

A policy bundle is one immutable release artifact with:

- one bundle identity;
- one version;
- one policy namespace;
- one governance-channel identity;
- one target-profile set;
- one supported runtime-version range;
- one complete included-module manifest;
- one provenance chain;
- one integrity and trust state;
- one activation and recovery contract.

A new canonical byte representation uses a new artifact identity.

### 4.2 Required bundle sections

| Section | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `identity` | Bundle identifier, semantic version, artifact class, governance release-channel identity, creation time, status, and language. |
| `scope` | Policy namespace, authority domains, target profiles, target runtime versions, component consumers, connectivity assumptions, and applicability constraints. |
| `contents` | Included deterministic policy modules, compiled artifacts, static data required by policy evaluation, and module manifests. |
| `compatibility` | Required system, service, knowledge, runtime, schema, profile, and Release Set versions; incompatible versions and conflicts. |
| `provenance` | Source revision, compiler, toolchain, configuration, producer identity, build worker, input artifacts, tests, and evidence. |
| `integrity and trust` | Digests, signatures, signing identity, trust scope, certificate or key references, revocation information, and validity interval. |
| `activation` | Preconditions, staging behavior, smoke tests, atomic switch mechanism, expected active state, and activation receipt policy. |
| `recovery` | Previous-state retention, rollback or restore artifact, forward-repair conditions, recovery tests, and recovery receipt policy. |
| `lifecycle` | Effective time, expiry, supersession, deprecation, revocation, archival, retention, export, and disposition rules. |

Raw secrets, private keys, arbitrary commands, unrestricted scripts, undeclared native code, and mutable provider dependencies remain outside the bundle.

### 4.3 Policy modules

Each policy module declares:

- module identifier and version;
- policy authority domain;
- accepted input contract;
- produced decision contract;
- deterministic evaluation behavior;
- precedence and conflict rules;
- dependencies;
- validity conditions;
- tests and evidence;
- deprecation and replacement relationships.

A module may implement authorization, disclosure, consent, privilege decisions, or governed exceptions only within the authority granted by active decisions, profiles, and contracts.

### 4.4 Build and compilation

Policy source is compiled through a registered deterministic toolchain.

The build records:

- source revision;
- compiler and toolchain identity;
- build configuration;
- dependency lock state;
- included schemas and static data;
- build worker identity;
- input artifact identities;
- tests and evidence;
- produced bundle identity.

A development build produces a candidate. Governance-channel publication and release approval remain separate.

### 4.5 Verification

| Check | Acceptance condition | Failure result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema | Bundle and every included module match active registered schemas. | Reject or quarantine |
| Identity | Bundle, module, dependency, and release identities are unique and resolvable. | Reject |
| Integrity | Artifact digests match the canonical bytes. | Quarantine |
| Signature and trust | Required signatures validate under an authorized non-revoked trust scope. | Reject or quarantine |
| Validity | Effective time, expiry, revocation, and supersession conditions permit use. | Reject or retain as historical only |
| Profile applicability | The target primary profile and overlays permit the policy runtime and bundle. | Block activation |
| Runtime compatibility | The policy runtime supports the bundle and module contract versions. | Block activation |
| Dependency compatibility | All referenced policy, schema, data, system, services, and knowledge dependencies resolve. | Block activation |
| Conflict analysis | Precedence, conflicts, duplicate domains, and incompatible rules have deterministic registered resolution. | Block activation |
| Authority boundaries | Rules remain within declared policy domains and do not acquire component, profile, trust, release, or resource authority. | Block activation |
| Behavior tests | Allow, deny, consent, disclosure, privilege, exception, break-glass, offline, and failure behavior passes registered tests. | Block activation |
| Recovery | Previous valid state and declared rollback, restore, or repair path are verified. | Block activation |

Verification is performed before staging, again before activation when required, and after transfer to a target whose trust or profile context differs.

### 4.6 Staging and quarantine

A verified source may enter staging. An offline, externally transferred, incompletely trusted, or failed candidate enters quarantine.

Neither state affects active policy evaluation.

Quarantine permits bounded inspection, verification, and deletion. It does not permit policy execution against authoritative requests.

### 4.7 Activation

Activation changes the complete active policy set used by Governance Policy Runtime.

The transition:

1. verifies the candidate;
2. verifies target state and compatibility;
3. runs pre-activation tests;
4. preserves the previous valid set;
5. stages the complete new set;
6. switches atomically;
7. runs post-activation health and decision tests;
8. records the outcome and recovery reference.

The active state is never an unvalidated mixture of old and new modules.

### 4.8 Release channel and Release Sets

The governance channel may update independently when declared compatibility remains satisfied.

A Release Set may bind governance with system, services, and knowledge-channel releases. In that case, bundle activation follows the Release Set's complete compatibility and non-partial activation rules.

An independent governance update cannot silently require an unavailable system, service, knowledge artifact, profile capability, or runtime version.

### 4.9 Trust and authority

Identity and Trust verifies signatures and signer scope. It does not decide policy correctness.

Governance Policy Runtime evaluates admitted policy modules. It does not create owner decisions.

The kOA Node Agent or equivalent profile-authorized local lifecycle component performs target-local activation. It does not define policy semantics.

Audit Broker records bounded policy and activation evidence. Observation does not transfer policy authority.

Resource Governor limits compilation, verification, loading, tests, and activation work. It does not grant authorization.

### 4.10 AI boundary

ChatGPT may help a user draft candidate policy text, examples, or tests outside the authoritative lifecycle. Such material remains candidate input until deterministic compilation, registered validation, review, and acceptance.

Suno, Gamma, and Ariane voice have no policy-bundle lifecycle authority.

No native or external AI service compiles, merges, resolves conflicts, authorizes, activates, repairs, or validates a bundle as an authoritative operation.

6. verify the previous valid set and recovery path;
7. request target-local activation;
8. switch to the complete new set atomically;
9. run post-activation tests;
10. produce activation and audit receipts;
11. retain the previous set according to recovery and retention policy.

### 6.5 Activate through a Release Set

1. Resolve the complete Release Set.
2. verify required channel membership;

7. verify system, services, governance, and knowledge state;
8. produce release and artifact activation receipts;
9. recover the complete prior valid state when the transition fails.

### 6.6 Roll back or repair

1. Identify the failed activation and affected bundle set.
2. resolve the declared recovery strategy;
3. verify the previous or repair artifact;
4. authorize the recovery transition;
5. stop new governed mutations when required;
6. restore, roll back, or forward-repair the complete policy set;
7. run decision, denial, exception, and health tests;
8. produce recovery and audit receipts;
9. invalidate unsupported evidence and claims.

### 6.7 Import through an offline bundle

1. Receive the selected offline bundle.
2. verify offline-bundle structure, integrity, signatures, signer trust, and transfer provenance;
3. import into quarantine;
4. extract and verify the policy bundle independently;
5. validate local profile, runtime, dependencies, conflicts, and compatibility;
6. stage the candidate;
7. require explicit local activation;
8. produce import, staging, activation, and recovery receipts as applicable.

### 6.8 Deprecate, revoke, or supersede

1. Record the lifecycle action and authority.
2. identify affected profiles, runtimes, Release Sets, targets, tests, evidence, and historical decisions;
3. define replacement or continued-use behavior;
4. prevent unsupported new activation;
5. preserve historical artifacts needed to reproduce prior decisions;
6. migrate or activate the replacement through ordinary procedures;
7. retain receipts, provenance, and recovery material;
8. dispose only after retention and dependency checks pass.

## 7. Failure States and Safe Degradation

| Failure state | Required behavior | Preserved state | Blocked behavior or claim |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Schema or manifest invalid | Reject the bundle before staging. | Current active policy set | Candidate use |
| Integrity mismatch | Quarantine the candidate and block dependent claims. | Current active policy set and historical evidence | Activation |
| Signature or trust failure | Reject or quarantine the candidate without changing active trust or policy. | Existing trusted policy set | Candidate authority |
| Bundle expired, revoked, or superseded | Prevent new activation and apply the registered active-state policy for already active bundles. | Historical receipts and reproducibility data | Unsupported continued claim |
| Runtime incompatibility | Block activation and preserve the current policy runtime and bundle. | Existing decisions | Schema guessing or automatic conversion |
| Policy conflict unresolved | Block activation. | Current deterministic decision behavior | Implicit precedence |
| Required test or evidence missing | Block the affected activation or conformance claim. | Candidate and logs as non-authoritative material | Release or activation approval |
| Staging storage pressure | Defer or reject the candidate and preserve recovery capacity. | Active bundle and recovery state | Additional staging |
| Activation process fails | Retain or restore the previous complete valid set and produce failure and recovery receipts. | Previous valid decision behavior | Partial active set |
| Governance Policy Runtime fails after switch | Revert or recover according to the declared strategy. | Previous valid set and recovery artifacts | Automatic unknown fallback |
| Control plane unavailable | Continue the previous valid local policy set and block unsupported new remote activations. | Node-local governance decisions | Unverified desired state |
| Network unavailable | Use already active local bundles and permit verified local offline import where the profile allows it. | Local policy behavior | Silent remote substitution |
| Audit Broker unavailable | Preserve local activation evidence and block a claim that requires unavailable audit registration. | Active policy and local receipts | Unsupported audit claim |
| Recovery artifact unavailable | Block activation before the switch. | Current active policy set | Unrecoverable transition |

A bundle failure never broadens policy, grants privilege, changes trust, creates a profile, or authorizes a partial policy set.

## 8. Cross-Component Interactions

| Producer or owner | Consumer | Interaction | Authority boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Policy source owner | Policy compiler | Accepted source, module identity, and authority domain | Compiler does not create owner decisions |
| Build farm | Governance release workflow | Candidate bundle, provenance, tests, evidence, and signatures | Candidate output is not release approval |
| Governance release channel | Target or control plane | Immutable bundle and manifest | Publication is not activation |
| Control plane | Target Node Agent | Coordinated desired bundle or Release Set | Target-local validation remains required |
| kOA Node Agent | Governance Policy Runtime | Stage and atomically activate the verified complete set | Node Agent does not define policy semantics |
| Governance Policy Runtime | Owning components | Deterministic policy decisions and receipts | Runtime does not acquire component data authority |
| Identity and Trust | Verifier and runtime | Signer identity, trust scope, and revocation | Signature validity is not policy correctness |
| Resource Governor | Compiler, verifier, runtime, and activation workers | CPU, memory, I/O, concurrency, queue, and process limits | Resource control is not policy authority |
| Audit Broker | Policy and release workflows | Selective policy-decision, activation, failure, and recovery records | Audit does not alter policy state |
| Offline-bundle importer | Local quarantine and staging | Signed controlled transfer | Import does not imply activation |
| Release Set | Target lifecycle | Cross-channel compatibility and coordinated activation | One channel cannot infer another channel's compatibility |
| Evidence registry | Release and conformance gates | Active valid bundle, test, activation, and recovery evidence | Evidence registration does not activate a bundle |

No interaction permits direct writes to another component's authoritative source tables.

## 9. Decision Closure and Prohibited Assumptions

### Accepted decisions

| Decision ID | Closed question |
| --- | --- |
| `DEC-SYS-001` | Governance artifacts operate inside the local-first, modular, explicit-authority system baseline. |
| `DEC-PROFILE-001` | Governance Policy Runtime and bundle applicability are profile-conditioned. |
| `DEC-DATA-001` | Policy runtime and lifecycle components cannot write another component's authoritative source tables directly. |
| `DEC-GOV-001` | Governance Policy Runtime owns policy decisions and remains separate from Resource Governor. |
| `DEC-REL-001` | Governance is one release channel and uses Release Sets, compatibility, non-partial activation, receipts, and recovery. |
| `DEC-AI-001` | Native and external AI have no authoritative policy-bundle lifecycle role. |

### Prohibited assumptions

- Every profile installs Governance Policy Runtime.
- A bundle is authoritative because it exists in a repository.
- A development build is a governance-channel release.
- A published bundle is active on every target.
- A valid signature proves correct policy behavior.
- A trusted signer can redefine an owner decision.
- A bundle can add its own trust root.
- Root or administrator identity may activate policy without profile and policy authorization.
- A control-plane request bypasses target validation.
- Independent governance updates may ignore other active channels.
- A Release Set may partially activate its governance modules.
- Unresolved policy conflicts may use document order or file order.
- A runtime may guess a missing schema or dependency.
- Offline import implies activation.
- Network loss permits remote fallback.
- Policy-runtime failure permits silent allow-by-default behavior.
- Break-glass rules may be introduced without stronger authority and receipts.
- External AI output is compiled policy authority.
- Historical bundles may be deleted when they are still required to reproduce decisions.
- Missing evidence may be replaced by operator confidence.

## 10. Validation Criteria

1. The metadata block parses as JSON and declares `DOC-LIFE-007`, status `active`, language `en`, lifecycle layer, and the two declared scopes.
2. All eleven required sections exist in numerical order.
3. Every decision ID is accepted in `generated/decision-index.json`.
4. Every requirement ID appears exactly once in `generated/requirements-index.json`.

These criteria define validation requirements. They do not claim that a particular policy source, bundle, signer, target, runtime, Release Set, or activation already conforms.

## 11. Non-Normative Examples

> **Non-normative example:** A bundle changes disclosure rules for one sovereign profile. The build records source, compiler, worker, inputs, tests, and evidence. The target verifies profile and runtime compatibility, stages the bundle, runs decision tests, switches atomically, and produces an activation receipt.

> **Non-normative example:** A signature validates, but the bundle targets a newer runtime contract than the node supports. Activation is blocked and the current policy set remains active.

> **Non-normative example:** Two included modules define incompatible outcomes for the same authority domain without a registered conflict rule. The bundle is rejected rather than using file order.

> **Non-normative example:** A control plane distributes a new governance-channel artifact. The target Node Agent independently verifies expected state, profile, compatibility, integrity, signatures, recovery readiness, and authorization before activating it.

> **Non-normative example:** An offline bundle arrives on removable media. The policy bundle enters quarantine, is verified locally, and remains inactive until an authorized local activation request succeeds.

> **Non-normative example:** ChatGPT proposes a candidate consent rule. A policy owner reviews it, records the required owner decision, implements deterministic policy source, compiles it with the registered toolchain, runs registered tests, and admits the resulting bundle through the ordinary lifecycle. The generated suggestion has no direct authority.
