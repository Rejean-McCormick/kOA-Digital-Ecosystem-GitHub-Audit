# Security, Privacy, and Semantic Boundaries

Arketype is a **design library**, not an operational storage or case-management service. Its neutral templates should remain free of real sensitive data.

## Records involving people

**Testimony / deposition** (`deposition-temoignage`) stores attributed statements and their provenance. The correct semantic form is “person X stated P,” not “P is established as true.” Original recordings, transcriptions, corrections, consent or other lawful collection basis, access restrictions, and evaluations should be distinguishable.

**Employee follow-up** (`dossier-suivi`) describes a casefile of documents, meetings, notes, actions and follow-ups. Sensitive employee information, allegations, assessments and decisions must not be conflated. An operational system needs enforceable permissions, retention/deletion policies, auditability, and applicable legal review.

**Medical or police protocols** (`procedure-protocole`) describe protocols and their branches. An archived protocol is not a live instruction, an executed authorization, or a replacement for current local policy, professional judgment and required approvals.

## System-state and diagnostic records

Distinguish observed state, desired configuration, inferred system health, reported symptoms, hypotheses, test results, and approved interventions. A suggestion to reboot a system is not authority to execute it.

## Cross-Kristal references and publication

- An external reference does not transfer semantic ownership.
- Pinning exact sources and their provenance is necessary when asserting reliance on outside work.
- A diagram, search index, reader view or Context Pack does not grant access to restricted data.
- Composition plans are `design_only`, with unresolved contracts and no publication authorization.
- No part of Arketype automatically pushes to a repository, qualifies facts, synchronizes data or activates a runtime.

## Recommended operational checklist

Before building a real application around an archetype, specify: the responsible data owner; user roles and access policies; lawful collection basis where relevant; retention; source attribution; immutable event history if required; version pinning; validation; error handling; and explicit publication/activation controls.

## New v11 boundary

An opaque KQ/KP identity is not a license to publish or verify a claim; a matching Wikidata QID or multilingual term is not evidence of exact equivalence without review. Arketype 1.6.0 neither allocates KQ, applies diK migration plans, nor pulls private graph text into network searches. Its optional diK alpha.7 bridge is explicitly configured and read-only. Kit draft.3 catalog adoption and migration are separate, reviewed producer operations, and a downloaded/local digest alone does not authenticate Wikidata facts. See [[Semantic-Authoring-v11]] and [[diK-Catalog-Exchange-v11]].
