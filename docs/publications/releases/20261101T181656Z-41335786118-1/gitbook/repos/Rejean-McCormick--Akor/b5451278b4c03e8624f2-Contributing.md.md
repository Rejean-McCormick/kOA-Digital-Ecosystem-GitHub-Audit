# Contributing to Akor Documentation

Akor is at its design and integration-qualification stage. Contributions are welcome in the form of clearer examples, tested contracts, classroom interaction research, accessibility scenarios, security reviews and architecture decisions.

## Proposing a change

1. Identify the user need and describe the interaction **between learners**, not only between applications.
2. Identify which existing repository owns the underlying data/state.
3. State what is implemented today and what remains a proposal.
4. Document privacy, access, educational evidence and fallback implications.
5. Propose a test that would fail before the implementation and pass after it.
6. Link the design to a reviewed source version without modifying unrelated project data.

## Writing style

- Use plain English, with exact French-Canadian source terms and IDs where needed.
- Do not equate narrative roles with permissions, or completion with mastery.
- Keep child-facing examples respectful and age-appropriate.
- Use **synthetic characters and test data** in examples.
- Favor short diagrams and complete, grounded end-to-end examples.
- Label provisional API sketches as **proposed** until verified against actual source.

## Documentation review

Every major document change should be reviewed for **educational intent**, **architecture ownership**, **security/privacy**, and **testing evidence**. A release note should identify the snapshot or commit used as its baseline.
