KONNAXION — AI IMPLEMENTATION RULES
===================================

1. IDENTITY

Konnaxion is an ecosystem system and a platform in its own scope.
Do not describe Konnaxion as a single app, and do not treat every thing called
"module" as the same architecture category.

2. CURRENT STACK

Frontend:
- Next.js / React / TypeScript
- App Router under frontend/app
- shared services/components/layout

Backend:
- Django + DRF
- PostgreSQL
- Celery + Redis
- AUTH_USER_MODEL = users.User
- ROOT_URLCONF = config.urls

3. CANONICAL OWNERS

ethiKos:
- konnaxion.ethikos
- topics, stances, arguments, sources, argument impact, participation roles,
  discussion visibility

EkoH:
- konnaxion.ekoh
- expertise taxonomy/scores, ethics context, confidentiality, rating access

Smart Vote:
- konnaxion.smart_vote
- source bindings, relevance lenses, declared readings

Do NOT create new canonical EkoH/Smart Vote code in konnaxion.kollective_intelligence.

4. SOURCE VS READING

Always preserve:

source fact != baseline != derived reading

For an ethiKos reading:
- EthikosStance remains source state;
- Smart Vote reads it;
- EkoH supplies context;
- Smart Vote returns a separate reading.

Do not write weighted values back into ethiKos source rows.
Do not invent a global per-person voting weight.

5. CURRENT SMART VOTE READING API

GET /api/v1/smart-vote/readings/ethikos-topic/<topic_id>/

The endpoint exists in the current snapshot.
If it returns no reading, the frontend must leave the reading absent; never copy
the baseline into the reading field.

6. EKOH

Preserve:
- domain-bounded expertise;
- non-authoritative contextual AI analysis;
- server-side rating disclosure;
- separation of identity privacy and rating visibility.

7. FRONTEND ROUTING

Current primary families include:
- /ethikos/*
- /ekoh/*
- /keenkonnect/*
- /konnected/*
- /kreative/*
- /konsensus/*
- /kontrol/*
- /reports/*
- /teambuilder/*

Inspect the actual App Router page before inventing a new path.

8. EXTERNAL SYSTEMS / INTERACTION KERNEL

Orgo, Kristal, SemantiK Architect and kOA-Linux are separate ecosystem systems.
Interaction Kernel (IK) is their distributed interoperability protocol, not a
central owner. The current Konnaxion documentation snapshot does not establish
an active IK-conformant adapter as qualified.

Target Konnaxion/Orgo profiles are governance.decision.execute/1.0.0 and
accountability.impact.publish/1.0.0. Treat them as target contracts unless
executable adapter evidence proves current conformance.

Never invent direct shared-database integration.
Never map Orgo Case to EthikosTopic or Orgo Task to a Konnaxion consultation by
identity.

9. kOA-LINUX

When Konnaxion is hosted by kOA-Linux, Konnaxion retains its domain authority.
Do not place host privilege/resource/runtime-activation state in Konnaxion
business models merely because Konnaxion runs on that platform.

10. K-PORT

K-Port is an EkoH evidence gateway/application, not a peer system of Konnaxion
and not the owner of EkoH scores.

11. BEFORE GENERATING CODE

Read the exact current source file and the nearest owner service/model.
Prefer extending the current owner rather than creating a parallel model.
Use explicit API/service boundaries for cross-domain interactions.
