# 22 — Implementation Backlog Template

**Project:** Konnaxion  
**Module:** ethiKos  
**Upgrade:** Kintsugi  
**Document ID:** `22_IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG_TEMPLATE.md`  
**Status:** Backlog generation template  
**Version:** `2026-04-25-kintsugi-doc-pack-v1`  
**Audience:** Human maintainers, implementation planners, AI coding agents, project managers, backend/frontend developers  
**Purpose:** Define the only approved format for converting the Kintsugi documentation pack into implementation tasks after documentation contracts and code-reading are complete.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the canonical implementation backlog format for the ethiKos Kintsugi upgrade.

It exists to prevent premature, speculative, or drifted implementation work.

The backlog must only be generated after:

1. the Kintsugi documentation pack is stable;
2. source-of-truth rules are accepted;
3. ownership boundaries are accepted;
4. canonical variables are accepted;
5. route-by-route upgrade mapping is accepted;
6. API/service contracts are accepted;
7. data/model/migration contracts are accepted;
8. Kialo-style argument mapping contract is accepted;
9. code snapshot inspection is complete;
10. first-pass OSS code reading is complete or explicitly waived.

This document does **not** contain the actual implementation backlog.

It defines the template that the real backlog must follow.

---

## 2. Scope

This template governs backlog items for:

- backend models;
- backend migrations;
- serializers;
- DRF ViewSets;
- API router registrations;
- frontend services;
- frontend route upgrades;
- UI components;
- Smart Vote readings;
- EkoH snapshot/context references;
- Kialo-style argument mapping;
- Konsultations intake/ballots/impact;
- tests;
- smoke checks;
- documentation updates;
- migration verification;
- rollback planning;
- QA sequencing.

This template does not authorize:

- full external OSS merge;
- annex/sidecar implementation in first pass;
- new route families outside `/ethikos/*`;
- new backend apps for Kialo, Loomio, Decidim, CONSUL, DemocracyOS, or Consider.it;
- destructive changes to existing Ethikos core models;
- premature implementation before contracts are stable.

---

## 5. Backlog Generation Rule

All backlog items MUST be generated from accepted documentation.

No task may exist without at least one source document reference.

```yaml id="wxs8ew"
BACKLOG_ITEM_REQUIRES:
  source_doc: true
  source_section: true
  owner_domain: true
  route_scope: true
  backend_scope: true
  frontend_scope: true
  test_scope: true
  risk_level: true
  rollback_note: true
  drift_check: true
```

Forbidden backlog origins:

```txt id="ef3qwl"
"AI intuition"
"nice-to-have feature"
"OSS repo has this so Ethikos should have it"
"route invented during implementation"
"model invented during implementation"
"endpoint invented during implementation"
"UI redesign unrelated to Kintsugi"
```

Valid backlog origins:

```txt id="utbl5i"
"Derived from 06_ROUTE_BY_ROUTE_ETHIKOS_UPGRADE_PLAN.md"
"Required by 08_DATA_MODEL_AND_MIGRATION_PLAN.md"
"Required by 09_SMART_VOTE_EKOH_READING_CONTRACT.md"
"Required by 21_KIALO_STYLE_ARGUMENT_MAPPING_CONTRACT.md"
"Required by current code snapshot mismatch"
"Required by known bug registry"
```

---

## 7. Backlog Status Values

Every backlog item MUST use one of these statuses.

```yaml id="dwbeuw"
BACKLOG_STATUS:
  - "candidate"
  - "ready_for_review"
  - "approved"
  - "blocked"
  - "in_progress"
  - "implemented"
  - "verified"
  - "deferred"
  - "rejected"
```

| `verified`         | Task passed tests and acceptance criteria.                   |
| `deferred`         | Valid task, but not in current implementation wave.          |
| `rejected`         | Task violates scope, ownership, or architecture constraints. |

---

## 8. Backlog Priority Values

```yaml id="mofri0"
PRIORITY:
  P0: "Required before any implementation can safely proceed."
  P1: "Required for first-pass Kintsugi implementation."
  P2: "Important but can follow first-pass implementation."
  P3: "Optional enhancement."
  P4: "Deferred future work."
```

### Priority Rules

* `P0` tasks are contract, safety, migration, or drift-control blockers.
* `P1` tasks are first-pass implementation requirements.
* `P2` tasks may improve completeness but are not blockers.
* `P3` tasks are optional enhancements.
* `P4` tasks must not be included in first-pass implementation.

---

## 9. Risk Values

```yaml id="f9dqlf"
RISK_LEVEL:
  LOW: "Small isolated change; no schema break; easy rollback."
  MEDIUM: "Crosses frontend/backend or adds schema; manageable rollback."
  HIGH: "Touches source-of-truth data, permissions, migrations, or result publication."
  CRITICAL: "Should not proceed without explicit ADR and human approval."
```

Any `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` task MUST include:

* explicit owner approval;
* rollback plan;
* migration safety note;
* test plan;
* drift-control check;
* affected docs list.

## 25. Dependency Rules

Backlog tasks must express dependencies explicitly.

### 25.1 Backend Before Frontend

Frontend tasks that consume new data must depend on backend/API tasks.

```txt id="frxrwe"
KIN-FE-### depends on KIN-API-### and/or KIN-BE-###
```

### 25.2 Migration Before Serializer

Serializer tasks that expose new model fields must depend on migration tasks.

```txt id="oz4dce"
KIN-API-### depends on KIN-MIG-###
```

### 25.3 Payload Contract Before UI

UI tasks that render new payloads must depend on payload contract tasks.

```txt id="iqwcvv"
KIN-FE-### depends on KIN-API-### and 13_PAYLOAD_SHAPES_AND_SERIALIZER_CONTRACT.md
```

### 25.4 Reading Before Result UI

Smart Vote result UI must depend on reading contract and backend reading result support.

```txt id="uvlgyz"
KIN-FE-### depends on KIN-BE-### + KIN-API-### + 09_SMART_VOTE_EKOH_READING_CONTRACT.md
```

### 25.5 Bugfix Isolation

Known bug tasks must not depend on unrelated architecture tasks unless code reading proves a direct dependency.

---

## 26. Acceptance Criteria Library

Use these reusable criteria when applicable.

### 26.1 General

```markdown id="kis8ub"
- [ ] Task is traceable to accepted Kintsugi docs.
- [ ] Task does not conflict with source-of-truth hierarchy.
- [ ] Task does not introduce route drift.
- [ ] Task does not introduce model naming drift.
- [ ] Task does not introduce ownership drift.
- [ ] Task does not introduce vote semantics drift.
- [ ] Task includes tests or explicit QA.
- [ ] Task includes rollback note.
```

### 26.2 Backend

```markdown id="v7qcon"
- [ ] Uses existing backend app unless explicitly approved.
- [ ] Uses DRF ViewSet/Serializer/Router pattern.
- [ ] Preserves existing endpoints.
- [ ] Adds only backward-compatible fields/tables.
- [ ] Does not mutate upstream facts from Smart Vote.
- [ ] Does not make EkoH a voting engine.
```

### 26.3 Frontend

```markdown id="ucul9o"
- [ ] Page remains under `/ethikos/*`.
- [ ] Existing module/global shell is preserved.
- [ ] No duplicate layout or theme system is introduced.
- [ ] API access goes through service layer.
- [ ] Loading, empty, error, and success states are handled.
```

### 26.4 Kialo-Style Deliberation

```markdown id="m7dpdt"
- [ ] `Claim` remains conceptual; backend model remains `EthikosArgument`.
- [ ] `ArgumentImpactVote` is separate from `EthikosStance`.
- [ ] Sources attach to argument/claim nodes.
- [ ] Suggested claims follow role/approval rules.
- [ ] Anonymous identities are protected from normal participants.
```

### 26.5 Smart Vote / EkoH

```markdown id="v3etft"
- [ ] Baseline remains visible.
- [ ] Reading is derived and reproducible.
- [ ] Reading stores `reading_key`, `lens_hash`, `snapshot_ref`, `computed_at`, and `results_payload`.
- [ ] EkoH is used as context only.
- [ ] Smart Vote does not mutate source facts.
```

---

## 27. Drift Rejection Rules

A backlog item MUST be rejected if it does any of the following.

```txt id="lq8m4d"
Creates /kialo route family.
Creates /kintsugi route family as implementation target.
Creates konnaxion.kialo.
Renames EthikosArgument to Claim.
Renames EthikosStance to Opinion.
Treats ArgumentImpactVote as EthikosStance.
Treats ReadingResult as source fact.
Uses Smart Vote to mutate Korum or Konsultations records.
Uses EkoH as voting engine.
Expands /api/home/*.
Imports external OSS app directly.
Adds Polis, LiquidFeedback, All Our Ideas, Your Priorities, or OpenSlides to first pass.
Introduces implementation tasks without source docs.
Introduces schema changes without migration/testing plan.
```

## 30. Example Candidate Task

This is an example of the expected format. It is not an approved task.

````markdown id="yc2ipj"

**Source Docs:**
- `12_CANONICAL_OBJECTS_AND_EVENTS.md#ArgumentSource`
- `21_KIALO_STYLE_ARGUMENT_MAPPING_CONTRACT.md#Sources`

### 1. Intent

Add a first-pass native Ethikos model for source links attached to `EthikosArgument`, supporting Kialo-style evidence transparency without creating a separate Kialo app.

### 2. Scope

This task includes:

- defining `ArgumentSource`;
- linking it to `EthikosArgument`;
- adding serializer support;
- adding API test coverage.

This task excludes:

- source export UI;
- custom source ranking;
- external citation crawling;
- importing Kialo code.

### 3. Current Reality

**Current frontend route(s):**

```txt
/ethikos/deliberate/[topic]
````

**Current backend endpoint(s):**

```txt
/api/ethikos/arguments/
```

**Current backend model(s):**

```txt
EthikosArgument
```

### 4. Target Change

Add source attachment support for argument nodes while preserving existing argument behavior.

### 5. Affected Files

**Backend:**

```txt
backend/konnaxion/ethikos/models.py
backend/konnaxion/ethikos/api/serializers.py
backend/konnaxion/ethikos/api/views.py
backend/config/api_router.py
```

**Tests:**

```txt
backend/konnaxion/ethikos/tests/
```

### 6. Data / Schema Impact

```yaml
SCHEMA_CHANGE_REQUIRED: true
MIGRATION_REQUIRED: true
NEW_MODEL_REQUIRED: true
EXISTING_MODEL_MODIFIED: false
DATA_BACKFILL_REQUIRED: false
```

### 7. API Contract Impact

```yaml
NEW_ENDPOINT_REQUIRED: true
EXISTING_ENDPOINT_CHANGED: false
SERIALIZER_CHANGED: true
BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE: true
```

### 8. Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] `EthikosArgument` remains unchanged in name and core semantics.
* [ ] `ArgumentSource` links to `EthikosArgument`.
* [ ] Existing argument posting still works.
* [ ] Source creation requires authenticated user.
* [ ] Tests cover creation and retrieval.
* [ ] No `/kialo` route or backend app is introduced.

### 9. Rollback Plan

Drop the new endpoint and model migration before production use, or disable source UI while preserving existing argument flow.

### 10. Drift Check

* [x] Uses `/ethikos/deliberate/*`.
* [x] Uses `konnaxion.ethikos`.
* [x] Does not rename `EthikosArgument`.
* [x] Does not import Kialo code.
