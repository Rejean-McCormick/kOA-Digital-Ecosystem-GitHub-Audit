# 06 — Route-by-Route ethiKos Upgrade Plan

**Document ID:** `06_ROUTE_BY_ROUTE_ETHIKOS_UPGRADE_PLAN.md`  
**Pack:** ethiKos Kintsugi Update Documentation Pack  
**Status:** Canonical planning document  
**Last aligned:** 2026-04-25  
**Primary scope:** Existing `/ethikos/*` route family  
**Implementation mode:** Partial native mimic, no full external merge

---

## 1. Purpose

This document maps the Kintsugi upgrade onto the existing ethiKos route surface.

The goal is to prevent route drift, feature drift, and architecture drift while upgrading ethiKos from a structured debate module into a full civic deliberation, drafting, decision, reading, and accountability engine.

This document defines:

- which existing ethiKos routes remain canonical;
- what each route family owns after the Kintsugi upgrade;
- which OSS-inspired patterns are allowed on each route;
- which backend domain each route should read from or write to;
- which routes should be upgraded, kept stable, or deferred;
- what must not be created as a parallel route family.

---

## 2. Scope

This document covers the existing frontend route family:

```txt
/ethikos/*
````

The canonical ethiKos route families are:

```txt
/ethikos/decide/*
/ethikos/deliberate/*
/ethikos/trust/*
/ethikos/pulse/*
/ethikos/impact/*
/ethikos/learn/*
/ethikos/insights
/ethikos/admin/*
```

This document does not define a new application, a new module shell, or a new top-level Kintsugi route.

---

## 3. Canonical Variables Used

```yaml
PRIMARY_ROUTE_SURFACE: "/ethikos/*"

PRIMARY_DELIBERATION_ROUTE: "/ethikos/deliberate/*"
PRIMARY_DECISION_ROUTE: "/ethikos/decide/*"
PRIMARY_IMPACT_ROUTE: "/ethikos/impact/*"
PRIMARY_ADMIN_ROUTE: "/ethikos/admin/*"

KINTSUGI_UPDATE_TYPE: "documentation-first architecture upgrade"
IMPLEMENTATION_STYLE: "partial native mimic"
FULL_EXTERNAL_MERGE_ALLOWED: false
ANNEX_FIRST_PASS_ALLOWED: false
EXISTING_ROUTE_FAMILIES_STABLE: true

KORUM_OWNS:
  - topics
  - stances
  - arguments
  - argument moderation
  - structured deliberation

KONSULTATIONS_OWNS:
  - intake
  - ballots
  - consultation results
  - impact tracking

SMART_VOTE_OWNS:
  - readings
  - lenses
  - result publication

EKOH_OWNS:
  - expertise context
  - ethics context
  - cohort eligibility
  - snapshots

KIALO_ROUTE_SCOPE: "/ethikos/deliberate/*"
KIALO_BACKEND_SCOPE: "konnaxion.ethikos"
KIALO_DISCUSSION_MAPPING: "Discussion -> EthikosTopic"
KIALO_CLAIM_MAPPING: "Claim -> EthikosArgument"
KIALO_EDGE_MAPPING: "parent + side"
KIALO_IMPACT_VOTE_IS_TOPIC_STANCE: false

LEGACY_OR_PROBLEMATIC_ENDPOINTS:
  - "/api/home/*"
```

---

## 4. Non-goals

The Kintsugi route upgrade MUST NOT:

* create a new `/kintsugi` top-level application;
* create a new `/kialo` route family;
* create a separate `konnaxion.kialo` backend app;
* replace existing `/ethikos/*` routes;
* rename `EthikosArgument` to `Claim`;
* rename `/api/ethikos/...` to `/api/deliberation/...`;
* convert EkoH into a voting engine;
* let Smart Vote mutate Korum or Konsultations source facts;
* expand legacy `/api/home/*` usage;
* create a second module shell or theme system;
* treat Kialo-style impact votes as topic-level stances;
* treat Kialo-style impact votes as Smart Vote ballots.

---

## 5. Current Route Surface

The existing ethiKos frontend already contains the required product surface for the Kintsugi upgrade.

```txt
/ethikos/admin/audit
/ethikos/admin/moderation
/ethikos/admin/roles

/ethikos/decide/elite
/ethikos/decide/public
/ethikos/decide/results
/ethikos/decide/methodology

/ethikos/deliberate/elite
/ethikos/deliberate/[topic]
/ethikos/deliberate/guidelines

/ethikos/impact/feedback
/ethikos/impact/outcomes
/ethikos/impact/tracker

/ethikos/insights

/ethikos/learn/changelog
/ethikos/learn/glossary
/ethikos/learn/guides

/ethikos/pulse/health
/ethikos/pulse/live
/ethikos/pulse/overview
/ethikos/pulse/trends

/ethikos/trust/badges
/ethikos/trust/credentials
/ethikos/trust/profile
```

These routes are sufficient for the Kintsugi first pass. New top-level civic routes SHOULD NOT be introduced unless a future ADR explicitly authorizes them.

## 7. Backend Alignment

### 7.1 Existing canonical backend endpoints

Current ethiKos core API endpoints:

```txt
/api/ethikos/topics/
/api/ethikos/stances/
/api/ethikos/arguments/
/api/ethikos/categories/
```

Current compatibility aliases:

```txt
/api/deliberate/...
/api/deliberate/elite/...
```

Current related decision/vote endpoint:

```txt
/api/kollective/votes/
```

### 7.2 Current core models

```txt
EthikosCategory
EthikosTopic
EthikosStance
EthikosArgument
```

### 7.3 Route upgrade principle

Routes SHOULD continue to read/write through the existing service layer and canonical API endpoints.

Legacy or problematic endpoints such as:

```txt
/api/home/*
```

MUST NOT be expanded. They SHOULD be replaced, isolated, or documented as legacy.

---

## 8. Frontend Shell Alignment

All ethiKos pages MUST remain inside the existing ethiKos/global shell.

Pages MUST NOT:

* create local full-page shells;
* redefine a separate major page header outside the module shell;
* define local breadcrumbs if handled globally;
* create a second theme system;
* bypass the established module layout pattern.

Expected shell behavior:

```txt
Global layout
  -> MainLayout
    -> ethiKos module layout
      -> EthikosPageShell
        -> Route page content
```

The Kintsugi upgrade is a route-content and service-contract upgrade, not a layout replacement.

---

# 9. Route-by-Route Upgrade Plan

---

## 9.1 `/ethikos/deliberate/[topic]`

### Current role

Topic-level deliberation page.

### Kintsugi role

Primary Korum workspace for structured argumentation.

This is the most important route for Kialo-style mimic.

### Canonical ownership

```yaml
Primary owner: Korum
Backend app: konnaxion.ethikos
Current model base:
  - EthikosTopic
  - EthikosArgument
  - EthikosStance
```

### First-pass upgrade targets

This route SHOULD become the primary structured argument workspace.

Required capabilities:

```txt
Argument tree
Claim detail panel
Pro/con branch visualization
Sources panel
Topic background panel
Topic-level stance capture
Claim-level impact vote distinction
Suggested claims queue
Role-aware participation
Author visibility awareness
Preview drawer fix
```

### Kialo-style mapping

```txt
Kialo Discussion -> EthikosTopic
Kialo Thesis -> EthikosTopic.title + description, later explicit thesis field
Kialo Claim -> EthikosArgument
Kialo Pro/Con relation -> EthikosArgument.parent + EthikosArgument.side
Kialo Source -> ArgumentSource
Kialo Impact Vote -> ArgumentImpactVote
Kialo Suggested Claim -> ArgumentSuggestion
```

### Vote separation

This route MUST distinguish:

```txt
EthikosStance:
  range: -3..+3
  meaning: user stance on topic
  model: EthikosStance

ArgumentImpactVote:
  range: 0..4
  meaning: impact/relevance/veracity of a claim relative to its parent
  proposed model: ArgumentImpactVote
```

### First-pass data additions

```txt
ArgumentSource
ArgumentImpactVote
ArgumentSuggestion
DiscussionParticipantRole
DiscussionVisibilitySetting
```

### Deferred data additions

```txt
ArgumentBookmark
ArgumentLink
DiscussionPerspective
DiscussionTemplate
DiscussionGroup
DiscussionExport
```

| Kialo-style | claim graph, pro/con relation, sources, impact voting, roles |
| Consider.it | reason capture and deliberative compression                  |
| DemocracyOS | proposal-centric discussion framing                          |

### Required anti-drift rules

```txt
Do not rename EthikosArgument to Claim.
Do not create /kialo routes.
Do not create konnaxion.kialo.
Do not treat impact votes as stances.
Do not treat impact votes as Smart Vote ballots.
```

# 13. Legacy Endpoint Cleanup Notes

The route upgrade should reduce or isolate legacy front-back links.

Problematic pattern:

```txt
/api/home/*
```

Policy:

```txt
Do not expand this usage.
Do not create new Kintsugi features on /api/home/*.
Replace with /api/ethikos/*, /api/kollective/*, or future documented endpoints.
If immediate replacement is unsafe, wrap behind service-layer adapter and mark legacy.
```

# 14. Known Bug Routing Note

## BUG-001

```yaml
title: "Deliberate preview drawer shows 'Preview / No data'"
status: "known_open"
route: "/ethikos/deliberate/[topic]"
classification: "targeted bugfix, not architecture"
```

This bug SHOULD be fixed during or before the `/ethikos/deliberate/[topic]` Kialo-style upgrade.

However, it MUST NOT be used as justification to redesign the route family, shell, or backend ownership model.

Likely category:

```txt
Preview drawer expects enriched topic preview shape, but receives raw topic or incompatible data.
```

Required handling:

```txt
Document expected preview payload.
Fix service-layer contract.
Avoid new raw fetch in page component.
```

---

# 15. Anti-Drift Rules

## 15.1 Route rules

```txt
Do not create /kintsugi as a product route.
Do not create /kialo as a product route.
Do not create /consult as a replacement for /ethikos/decide.
Do not create /debate as a replacement for /ethikos/deliberate.
Do not move ethiKos pages out of /ethikos/*.
```

## 15.2 Backend rules

```txt
Do not rename konnaxion.ethikos.
Do not create konnaxion.kialo in first pass.
Do not rename EthikosArgument to Claim.
Do not remove EthikosStance.
Do not rename /api/ethikos/* to /api/deliberation/*.
Do not let Smart Vote mutate upstream facts.
Do not let EkoH mutate ballots or stances.
```

## 15.3 Frontend rules

```txt
Do not create a second ethiKos shell.
Do not bypass EthikosPageShell.
Do not create a separate theme system.
Do not add raw fetch calls directly in page components unless documented.
Do not use route pages as data ownership sources.
```

## 15.4 Voting rules

```txt
EthikosStance = topic-level stance, range -3..+3.
ArgumentImpactVote = claim-level impact score, range 0..4.
Smart Vote Reading = derived result, reproducible from baseline events and lens declaration.
These three must never be collapsed into one concept.
```

# 16. Implementation Sequencing Notes

This document does not define the implementation backlog. It defines the route map that the backlog must obey.

Recommended implementation order after the documentation pack is complete:

```txt
1. Fix /ethikos/deliberate/[topic] preview contract.
2. Stabilize deliberate service layer.
3. Add Kialo-style argument tree/source/impact-vote contracts.
4. Add decision protocol/result reading contracts.
5. Add Smart Vote result display contracts.
6. Add impact tracking contracts.
7. Add admin audit/moderation/roles contracts.
8. Add glossary and methodology pages.
9. Add pulse/insights refinements.
```

# 18. Final Route Contract

The Kintsugi upgrade MUST land inside the existing ethiKos route surface.

```txt
Kintsugi is not a new app.
Kintsugi is not a new route family.
Kintsugi is the route-by-route strengthening of ethiKos.
```

Canonical final mapping:

```txt
/ethikos/deliberate/* = Korum structured deliberation
/ethikos/decide/* = Konsultations decision + Smart Vote readings
/ethikos/impact/* = Konsultations accountability
/ethikos/pulse/* = civic health and live signals
/ethikos/trust/* = EkoH context visibility
/ethikos/admin/* = audit, moderation, roles
/ethikos/learn/* = methodology and public explanation
/ethikos/insights = analytics and reading comparison
```
