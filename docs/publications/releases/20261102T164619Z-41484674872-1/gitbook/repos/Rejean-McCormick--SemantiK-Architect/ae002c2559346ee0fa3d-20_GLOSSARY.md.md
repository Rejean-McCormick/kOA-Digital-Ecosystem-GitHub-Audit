# Glossary

Status: **normative terminology**

**ACL (Anti-Corruption Layer)** — boundary mapping external domain models into SA canonical contracts.

**Communication** — one bounded SA unit of human-facing output; may include several sentences and presentation blocks.

**CommunicationObligation** — semantic content that MUST be communicated for the request to succeed.

**CommunicationContext** — audience/language/register/channel information that controls articulation without selecting facts.

**CommunicationPlan** — language-neutral grouping, sequence and discourse plan over obligations.

**CommunicationRequest** — canonical input aggregate.

**CommunicationResult** — canonical structured output plus coverage and runtime identity.

**LanguagePlan** — target-language-specific, realizer-neutral output structure containing realization units.

**RealizationUnit** — one planned grammatical unit referencing a versioned SA↔GF operation.

**RuntimeSet** — immutable composition of grammar, lexical, locale, capability and conformance artifacts pinned for a request.

**SemanticGraph** — structured request meaning represented by typed nodes and predicate-role statements.

**SupportingSemanticContext** — semantic/lexical information used to communicate correctly but not itself required as an output claim.

**SA↔GF Contract** — versioned bridge operation/feature contract between SA planning and GF realization.

**Capability Profile** — versioned set of communication/grammar requirements that a language/runtime must pass before release.

**Coverage** — mapping proving every communication obligation was discharged by output units.

**Faithfulness** — preservation of supplied meaning without invention, omission, role swap, status elevation or hidden reinterpretation.

**Released language/profile** — a language/profile pair with immutable passing conformance evidence in the active RuntimeSet.

**LexicalPlanningContext** — ephemeral language-specific lexical facts used by the LanguagePlanner before final construction selection.

**LexicalBindingSet** — immutable mapping from LanguagePlan lexical slots to exact runtime lexical references consumed by the realizer.

**Kristal portable-v6 communication projection** — explicit ACL boundary object linking a pinned `kristal_state/6.0` artifact/projection and selected assertion metadata to one canonical `CommunicationRequest`; metadata remains supporting context unless explicitly mapped into an obligation. Kristall v7 may be the upstream semantic authority without changing this portable SA boundary.

**Actionability (Kristal v6)** — upstream policy metadata such as `automatic`, `human_review`, or `human_decision`; SA preserves it as context but never treats it as execution authority or a communicative force.

**DaaT** — optional Interaction Kernel anti-corruption/admission and explicit contract-mapping boundary (`daat` machine id) in front of Kristal/Kristall; not a communication-selection authority.

**Kompiler** — read-only context compiler; assembled context can support a request but cannot create truth, semantic identity or communication obligations.
