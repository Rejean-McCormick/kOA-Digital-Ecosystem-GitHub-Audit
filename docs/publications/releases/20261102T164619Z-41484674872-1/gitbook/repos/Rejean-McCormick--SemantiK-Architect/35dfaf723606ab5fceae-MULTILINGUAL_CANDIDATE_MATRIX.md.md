# Multilingual Candidate Matrix

Status: **informative implementation reference**

## Purpose

`CandidateMatrixConformance` runs the same SemantiK Architect candidate-conformance path across multiple immutable language/profile candidate bundles and produces one review result per language.

It exists to support cross-language development and evidence gathering without moving GF/RGL language construction into SA.

## Boundary

The matrix **consumes** candidate bundles that already contain:

- `grammar.pgf`;
- `bridge.json`;
- `lexicon.json`;
- `profile.json`;
- `conformance.suite.json`;
- `pipeline.lock.json`.

It does **not** compile a GF language, edit RGL sources, create a production RuntimeSet, write release evidence, or activate a runtime.

The authority flow therefore remains:

```text
GF/RGL language source
  -> external build
  -> immutable SA candidate bundle
  -> CandidateMatrixConformance
  -> review result
  -> normal release gate (separate)
```

## API

```python
from semantik_architect.conformance import CandidateMatrixConformance

report = CandidateMatrixConformance().run([
    {
        "candidate_root": "state/candidates/Fre/semantik-core-fr-lab-1",
        "runtime_set_id": "semantik-core-fr-lab-1",
        "metadata": {"rgl_code": "Fre"},
    },
    {
        "candidate_root": "state/candidates/Eng/semantik-core-en-lab-1",
        "runtime_set_id": "semantik-core-en-lab-1",
        "metadata": {"rgl_code": "Eng"},
    },
])
```

For each suite case the matrix records:

- pass/fail;
- realized `plain_text`;
- the SA↔GF operation IDs selected by the validated `LanguagePlan`;
- a deterministic error string when the case fails.

## Identity checks

Before running a candidate, the matrix requires the suite language, capability profile and runtime-set identity to match `pipeline.lock.json`. Candidate artifact integrity remains enforced by `CandidateConformance`.

## Release semantics

A matrix `PASS` is development evidence only. It is **not** equivalent to `RELEASED` under the Language Conformance Lock. Production release still requires all release gates, immutable evidence pinning and an admitted RuntimeSet.


## Candidate extension capabilities (SA 1.2.1)

A candidate `pipeline.lock.json` may declare an additive `extension_capabilities` array.
Each entry must be a known SA↔GF operation ID. The operations are admitted in addition
to the selected profile's `required_operations` for **candidate conformance only**.

This mirrors the production capability-manifest model already consumed by
`ManifestCapabilityAdapter.require_plan`: a stable common profile plus explicit
per-language extensions. It does not weaken the binary release semantics of the base profile.

Example:

```json
{
  "profile_id": "semantik-multilingual-core-1",
  "extension_capabilities": ["clause.passive_event"]
}
```

Rules are fail-closed:

- the field, when present, must be an array;
- every operation ID must exist in the SA↔GF v1 operation catalog;
- duplicates are rejected;
- the matrix report exposes the admitted extensions for each language;
- absence of the field remains backward compatible and means no extensions.

The field never releases or activates an operation. It only lets an immutable candidate
prove that operation through the existing SA planning, lexical binding and GF bridge path.
