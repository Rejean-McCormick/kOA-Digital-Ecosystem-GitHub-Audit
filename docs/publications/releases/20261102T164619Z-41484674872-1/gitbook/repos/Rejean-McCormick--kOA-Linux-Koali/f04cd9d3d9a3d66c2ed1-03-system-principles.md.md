# System Principles

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how the constitutional principles of the kOA Operating Environment apply across system design, implementation, operation, integration, lifecycle management, recovery, and conformance.

It explains the global principles that constrain every profile, overlay, component, artifact class, integration, release, and operational procedure. The canonical system model remains in `contracts/system.contract.json`; this document supplies the normative interpretation required to apply that model consistently.

The intended outcome is deterministic reasoning: the same architectural fact produces the same authority, scope, failure, evidence, and recovery conclusions regardless of which component or profile applies it.

## 2. Scope

This document applies globally to:

- all primary deployment profiles;
- all composable profile overlays;
- all components and component contracts;
- all development and build toolchains;
- all release channels and artifact classes;
- all internal and external integrations;
- all runtime, lifecycle, security, operations, conformance, and migration activities;
- all human and automated actors that make, validate, execute, or review architectural changes.

This document governs principles rather than component-specific behavior. Component interfaces, internal states, storage layouts, profile memberships, hardware selections, artifact structures, and integration payloads remain owned by their dedicated canonical contracts.

Implementation choices such as systemd, Quadlet, Podman, Docker, Wayland, GNOME, KDE Plasma, and Kubernetes are outside global constitutional scope unless an active profile or overlay adopts them explicitly.

Historical or migration material may explain lineage, but it does not create current product authority.

## 4. Model and Responsibilities

### 4.1 Principle model

A system principle is a global rule for interpreting and constraining architecture. It does not replace the canonical data model of a component, profile, integration, or artifact class.

Each principle has five effects:

1. it defines an architectural direction;
2. it constrains lower-scope contracts;
3. it establishes prohibited assumptions;
4. it determines failure and degradation expectations;
5. it establishes the evidence required for a conformance claim.

A lower-scope object may strengthen a global principle. It may not weaken, silently reinterpret, or bypass it.

### 4.2 Core principles

| Principle | Meaning | Primary canonical owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit authority | Every consequential action has an identifiable authority source and scope. | `authority.registry.json`, owner registries, and component contracts |
| Fail-closed authority | Missing or invalid authority blocks the affected action without fabricating permission. | `system.registry.json#/degradation_baseline` |
| Local-first continuity | Applicable local capabilities remain usable without Internet or optional remote services. | `system.registry.json#/offline_baseline` |
| Deterministic core | Native authoritative behavior does not depend on generative or autonomous AI. | `system.registry.json#/ai_boundary` |
| Component separation | Responsibilities, authoritative data, and state transitions have exclusive owners. | `components.registry.json` |
| Scope discipline | Global, profile, overlay, component, artifact, and toolchain rules remain distinct. | `system.registry.json#/architectural_layers` |
| Safe degradation | Failure removes or limits only the affected capability and preserves valid state. | `system.registry.json#/degradation_baseline` |
| Controlled integration | External services are explicit, bounded, removable, and non-authoritative. | `integrations.registry.json` |
| Resource proportionality | Background and heavy work remain bounded by the active resource envelope. | `system.registry.json#/resource_governance` |
| Selective accountability | Evidence supports verification and recourse without indiscriminate disclosure. | security, audit, receipt, and evidence contracts |
| Portability and exit | Data and artifacts remain exportable, restorable, migratable, and independently usable. | lifecycle and artifact contracts |
| Recoverable activation | Authoritative transitions avoid partial state and retain a recovery path. | artifact and release contracts |
| Cultural rights and consent | Rights and consent remain attached to content across system transitions. | cultural-rights and publication contracts |
| Traceable authority | Active claims resolve to canonical sources, decisions, requirements, tests, and evidence. | `traceability.registry.json` |

### 4.3 Authority responsibilities

The owning component authorizes ordinary operations within its contract. A governance policy runtime authorizes policy-governed disclosure, consent, exceptions, and sensitive privilege decisions where a profile deploys that runtime. A narrow privileged operation path performs only the host mutation already authorized by applicable policy and profile contracts.

Resource Governor manages resource allocation and scheduling. It does not decide whether an actor may disclose information, exercise privilege, or accept an exception.

Publication Gateway controls cross-domain disclosure and publication. The UCKK Publication Bridge performs UCKK-specific outbound packaging and transport only after that authorization. The separate UCKK Import Bridge retrieves selected learning packages into quarantine and submits them to deterministic validation and explicit local acceptance. Neither bridge can substitute for the governing authority or create implicit synchronization.

The user language runtime consumes compiled artifacts. Language construction and compilation belong to the designated build workbench.

### 4.4 Scope responsibilities

The global baseline defines behavior that applies to every deployment. A primary profile selects a deployable operating form. An overlay strengthens or specializes an explicitly compatible primary profile. A component contract defines internal responsibility within global and profile boundaries. A recipe illustrates one implementation and has no independent authority.

The narrower object is responsible for proving that its choices remain inside all higher-scope boundaries.

## 6. Procedures or State Transitions

### 6.1 Applying a principle to an architectural change

1. Identify the architectural fact being changed.
2. Resolve its exclusive canonical owner.
3. Determine whether the change is global, profile-specific, overlay-specific, component-specific, artifact-specific, or toolchain-specific.
4. Resolve the accepted decision authorizing the semantic change.
5. Identify all applicable constitutional requirements and alignment locks.
6. Update the canonical owner before explanatory or generated projections.
7. Compute direct and transitive impact across profiles, components, contracts, documents, tests, evidence, and AI contexts.
8. Update affected lower-scope contracts without weakening higher-scope principles.
9. Execute applicable validation and conformance tests.
10. Produce evidence for every claim affected by the change.
11. Activate the new authority only after all applicable checks pass.
12. Preserve the previous valid state or provide an explicit forward-repair path.

Completion occurs when the canonical owner, dependent objects, tests, evidence, and active authority release agree.

### 6.2 Resolving authority for an operation

1. Identify the requested capability and its owning component.
2. Resolve the active profile and overlays.
3. Resolve applicable component, security, lifecycle, and integration contracts.
4. Confirm actor, policy, and privilege authority at the required scope.
5. Validate inputs and compatibility.
6. Execute only the operation authorized by the resolved contracts.
7. Produce a receipt when the operation is a critical transition.
8. Reject the operation when authority remains missing, ambiguous, expired, or incompatible.

No fallback may broaden authority.

### 6.3 Applying a profile-specific rule

1. Resolve one active primary profile.
2. Resolve zero or more explicitly compatible overlays.
3. Load only requirements and components applicable to that composition.
4. Preserve all global constitutional and system-baseline rules.
5. Apply profile-specific implementation choices only inside that composition.
6. Reject implicit inheritance and incompatible overlay combinations.
7. Record the resulting conformance scope.

A profile rule affects no other profile unless a separate accepted decision changes the global baseline or the other profile contract.

### 6.4 Using an external integration

1. Confirm that the integration exists in `contracts/integration-types.contract.json`.
2. Confirm that the active profile permits the integration.
3. Require explicit user initiation for the specific capability.
4. disclose the data selected for transfer;
5. export only the admitted input;
6. receive the output as non-authoritative candidate material;
7. validate and import the output through the owning component;
8. obtain any required user or policy acceptance;
9. record provenance or a decision receipt when applicable;
10. preserve unrelated local capability when the integration fails or is removed.

### 6.5 Activating an authoritative artifact

1. Validate the artifact contract and schema.
2. Validate compatibility with the active release set.
3. Verify integrity and signature when required by the artifact class.
4. Confirm policy and profile authorization.
5. create or verify a recovery point;
6. stage the complete candidate state;
7. activate atomically or transactionally;
8. verify the resulting state;
9. produce an activation receipt;
10. retain rollback or forward-repair capability.

A failed activation preserves the previous valid authoritative state.

## 7. Failure States and Safe Degradation

| Failure condition | Required behavior | Authority retained | Authority denied | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Missing, ambiguous, or incompatible authority | Block the affected operation and report the unresolved authority source. | Previously valid state and unrelated capabilities | Requested mutation or transition | Validation failure or decision receipt |
| External integration unavailable | Mark only the external capability unavailable. | Local operation, local navigation, and authoritative stores | External request and automatic substitution | Integration failure record |
| Ariane voice adapter unavailable | Disable voice interaction without changing local command authority. | Keyboard, pointer, touch, menus, accessibility controls, and local shortcuts | External voice capability | Capability-status evidence |
| Resource pressure | Defer background work, reduce concurrency, and stop task-activated heavy services. | Authoritative data integrity and core control | Excess concurrency and nonessential heavy work | Resource-governance metrics |
| Component failure | Isolate the failed component and preserve other component boundaries. | Unaffected component authority | Cross-boundary repair or direct database mutation | Component health and incident evidence |
| Contract or schema incompatibility | Block import, activation, or communication using the incompatible object. | Existing valid state | Candidate incompatible state | Contract-validation report |
| Integrity or signature failure | Reject the affected artifact before import, activation, publication, or restore. | Previously verified artifact state | Unverified artifact authority | Integrity or signature verification evidence |
| Activation failure | Abort or reverse the transition without partial authority. | Previous valid active version | Partially staged or failed candidate version | Failure and recovery receipts |
| Offline transition | Remove remote-only capabilities and continue within the declared offline envelope. | Declared local capabilities | Remote-only capability | Offline conformance evidence |
| Audit subsystem unavailable | Preserve primary component state and queue only bounded evidence work when allowed. | Owning component authority | Unsupported audit or conformance claim | Health record and deferred-evidence status |
| Recovery input invalid | Reject restore and retain the current valid state when safe. | Current verified state | Invalid restored state | Restore-validation report |
| Missing traceability or evidence | Block the affected conformance, release, or authority claim. | Existing independently supported claims | Unsupported claim | Traceability-validation failure |

## 8. Cross-Component Interactions

| Producer | Consumer | Canonical contract | Direction | Authority boundary | Failure ownership |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Owning component | Another component | Versioned API, command, event, gateway, exported artifact, or declared read model | Explicit and contract-defined | Consumer cannot acquire write authority over producer data | Producer owns source-state failure; consumer owns import and local-state failure |
| Resource Governor | Components and workers | Component and profile resource envelopes | Control and observation | Resource decisions do not grant policy or data authority | Resource Governor owns scheduling and limit enforcement |
| Governance Policy Runtime | Privileged broker, Publication Gateway, or governed component | Policy decision and receipt contracts | Authorization decision | Policy authorizes; execution remains with the receiving component or broker | Policy runtime owns decision failure; executor owns operation failure |
| UCKK Publication Bridge | External UCKK Moodle platform | UCKK publication integration | Authorized outbound package transport | Bridge owns packaging and transfer state; kOA Mediatheque retains local source authority; UCKK owns only its destination copy | Bridge owns transfer failure; external UCKK owns destination acceptance failure |
| UCKK Import Bridge | kOA Mediatheque | UCKK import integration and learning-package contracts | Inbound retrieval, quarantine, validation, and acceptance handoff | Bridge owns transfer and quarantine state; UCKK retains remote source authority; kOA Mediatheque decides local acceptance and owns the distinct local copy | Bridge owns retrieval and validation failure; kOA Mediatheque owns acceptance failure |
| Publication Gateway | External audience or domain | Publication request and receipt contracts | Controlled outward disclosure | Gateway cannot rewrite source-domain authority | Gateway owns disclosure and delivery failure |
| GF Wordbench | Language artifact repository | Language-pack and runtime-pack contracts | Build and publish | Build workbench produces artifacts; runtime does not compile them | Workbench owns build failure; repository owns admission failure |
| SemantiK Architect Runtime | User-facing components | Compiled runtime contract | Read and evaluate | Runtime consumes approved compiled artifacts only | Runtime owns evaluation failure |
| External integration | Owning component | Integration registry and import contract | Candidate output inward | External output has no direct authority | Integration owns remote failure; component owns validation and acceptance |
| Build Farm | Artifact registry or release process | Artifact-class, provenance, and release-set contracts | Build, validate, publish | Build output gains authority only after required validation and activation | Build Farm owns build evidence; activation owner owns release transition |
| Audit Broker | Authorized evidence consumer | Audit and evidence contract | Selective evidence disclosure | Evidence access does not grant operational or source-data authority | Audit Broker owns collection and disclosure failure |

Direct cross-component writes to authoritative source tables are prohibited. Shared infrastructure, physical database processes, caches, and read models do not transfer logical ownership.

## 9. Decision Closure and Prohibited Assumptions

### Accepted decisions

| Decision ID | Effect on this document |
| --- | --- |

### Prohibited assumptions

- A system administrator, root process, deployment controller, or AI agent possesses unlimited application authority.
- A commonly used implementation becomes globally required through prevalence.
- A profile rule applies to another profile without explicit composition or inheritance.
- Physical database consolidation permits cross-component writes.
- An external integration output is authoritative because a user requested it.
- Read-only access, caching, indexing, or transformation transfers ownership.
- Resource allocation decisions imply authorization, disclosure, consent, or privilege decisions.
- Publication Gateway and UCKK Publication Bridge are interchangeable.
- UCKK Publication Bridge and UCKK Import Bridge are one bidirectional synchronization service.
- A shared Mediatheque frame implies shared authority, storage, identity, access control, or lifecycle.
- User runtime components may silently perform build-workbench functions.
- Network availability is required for local authoritative operation.
- Failure permits partial authoritative activation or silent substitution.
- Auditability requires indiscriminate disclosure.
- Backup availability alone proves recoverability without a verified restore path.
- Generated documentation, recipes, prompts, tickets, code comments, or implementation defaults create architectural authority.

## 10. Validation Criteria

5. Every lock ID exists in `generated/assertion-index.json` and contains an executable assertion or assigned manual control.
6. No lower-scope profile, overlay, component, integration, artifact, or recipe weakens a requirement in this document.
7. `TEST-CONST-PRIN-001` verifies explicit authority and fail-closed behavior for missing authority.
8. `TEST-CONST-PRIN-002` verifies that all profiles declare an offline capability envelope.
9. `TEST-CONST-PRIN-003` verifies absence of prohibited native AI dependencies in the global baseline.
10. `TEST-CONST-PRIN-004` verifies exclusive component data ownership and rejects cross-component source-table writes.
11. `TEST-CONST-PRIN-005` verifies explicit profile composition and rejects incompatible or implicit inheritance.
12. `TEST-CONST-PRIN-006` verifies capability-scoped degradation under external-service and resource failure.
13. `TEST-CONST-PRIN-007` verifies integration allowlisting, transfer disclosure, candidate-output handling, and removal behavior.

These criteria define required validation. They do not claim that the tests have already executed or that conformance evidence already exists.

## 11. Non-Normative Examples

> **Non-normative example:** This example illustrates one valid implementation or scenario. It does not redefine the canonical contract.

A user profile loses Internet access while editing local data. Local storage, deterministic Ariane navigation, compiled language artifacts, and local kOA Mediatheque operations continue within the profile's offline envelope. ChatGPT, Suno, Gamma, and external Ariane voice become unavailable. The system does not substitute an unregistered provider.

> **Non-normative example:** This example illustrates one valid implementation or scenario. It does not redefine the canonical contract.

A component needs information owned by another component. It requests a versioned API response or consumes an authorized event. It may cache a declared read model, but it does not write to the producer's database or reinterpret the producer's state as its own authority.

> **Non-normative example:** This example illustrates one valid implementation or scenario. It does not redefine the canonical contract.

A lightweight deployment and a sovereign node may use different process, storage, desktop, and container layouts. Both remain conformant when each follows its active profile contract and both preserve global authority, separation, offline, recovery, and evidence principles.

> **Non-normative example:** This example illustrates one valid implementation or scenario. It does not redefine the canonical contract.

A service update passes contract, compatibility, integrity, and signature checks. The deployment stages the complete candidate, creates a recovery point, switches atomically, verifies the result, and emits an activation receipt. A failed verification leaves the previous valid version active.

> **Non-normative example:** This example illustrates one valid implementation or scenario. It does not redefine the canonical contract.

An external service produces a candidate presentation. The result is re-imported through a controlled component workflow, provenance is recorded, and a user approves it before publication. The external provider never writes directly to the authoritative publication store.
