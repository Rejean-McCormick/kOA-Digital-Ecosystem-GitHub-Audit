# Framework v11 and diK integration

Arketype 1.6.0 retains its **design-only** role. A semantic entity is identified by `KQ` in its namespace, while a property is `KP`. `KA` statements and `KS` source identities are distinct. Wikidata Q/P remain **external** mappings in a reviewed crosswalk. Dictionary words and translated labels are **not** identities in Framework v11 canonical graphs.

Use `python arketype.py create --type referentiel-semantique --slug my-kristal --title 'My Kristal' --parent . --authoring v11` to create a **new empty** local Kit4 workspace with a readiness guide; no fake KQ IDs are issued and strict v11 stays disabled until registration of real graph, identity registry, crosswalk and lexical catalog. The 19 old templates remain valid unchanged in legacy mode.

Use `python arketype.py semantic-status --path /path/to/my-kristal` for **metadata-only** readout. Use `python arketype.py dik-coverage --dik-root /trusted/diK-v1.0.0-alpha.7 --project /path/to/dik.project.json --locales fr,en,fr-CA` for **read-only** actual diK lexical completeness, subject to actual named local files. A missing translation is not guessed; a French fallback is not a direct French-Canadian translation.

Migration of historical textual identities requires a scoped, independently reviewed plan and execution by an authorized Authoring Kit producer. It never replaces quotes or changes committed source history. No action above publishes, activates or qualifies a Kristal.

See [Ecosystem Compatibility](Ecosystem-Compatibility.md) and `docs/14_FRAMEWORK_V11_ET_DIK.md` in the main repository for contract details.

## Arketype 1.6.0 interoperability limitations

- **Framework** `11.0.0-draft.4` is the design reference; Arketype does not alter normative Framework schemas.
- **Authoring Kit** `4.0.0-draft.3` is selected only with `--authoring v11`. The 19 historical templates retain Kit `3.2.4`.
- **diK** `1.0.0-alpha.7` remains a separate source checkout explicitly selected for read-only coverage reporting. Dictionary curation, bulk import and migration planning belong to diK and the Authoring Kit.

End-to-end conformance requires validating exact repository versions together; `vendored_source_verified` checks copied Kit bytes, not the complete runtime or Framework conformance. The uploaded snapshot also has outstanding packaging and validation failures described in [[Snapshot-Verification-2026-10-27]].
